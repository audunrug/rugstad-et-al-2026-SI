    abstract = {In 2015, the Fund{\~a}o Dam collapse released over 40 million m3 of iron mine tailings, causing several environmental damages. Certain affected areas were revegetated with a mix of fast-growing species that can allowed the return of some organisms of soil fauna. Nematodes are the most abundant multicellular organisms in soil and are commonly used as bioindicators. Therefore, this study aimed to use the nematode community as bioindicators of the restoration process of an area affected by iron tailings at the margins of the Gualaxo do Norte River. Soil samples were collected from affected and native forest areas to perform physical, chemical, biochemical, and biological analyses. Nematodes were identified and classified according to feeding habits and on a colonizer-persisters (cp) scale. A non-metrical multidimensional scaling and PERMANOVA were conducted to assess differences between communities. Shannon's diversity index and the maturity index were significantly higher in the restoration area. There was a difference in the composition and the structure of nematode communities of the restoration and reference area, nematode genus occurrence and abundance were different between the areas resulting in differences in feeding habits and life strategies according to the cp scale. The cp-5 nematodes are more abundant in the restoration area and cp-1 in the forest reference area. Bacterivore nematodes were more abundant in the reference forest area. In addition, the soil attributes in the restoration area were altered following the tailings deposition. Such alterations include high pH, low organic matter content, and low microbial biomass, which consequently influenced the structure and the composition of the nematode community. This is likely the first report of soil nematode community diversity in the areas of the Rio Doce Basin impacted by the Fund{\~a}o tailings, and nematodes proved to be good bioindicators to show the differences between the restoration and forest reference area.},

    abstract = {Coastal dunes represent priority habitats for conservation due to the provision of valuable ecosystem services such as land protection, water supply or biodiversity conservation. Soil microbial communities are of crucial importance to maintain plant diversity due to harsh environmental conditions, water limitation and nutrient scarcity. Invasive alien plants represent a major threat to ecosystem conservation. Here, we explored different impacts of Carpobrotus edulis, a succulent plant invading coastal areas worldwide, on the function and structure of bacterial communities. Sand represents a challenging substrate due to low organic matter content and limited microbial activity. We optimized bacterial extraction for functional evaluation before assessing ecosystem impacts produced by C. edulis. We compared 12 extracting procedures combining different soil storage, sample amount and extracting solutions on the functional activity of sand communities through the community-level physiological profile. We further explored the function (using Biolog Ecoplates) and structure [using polymerase chain reaction--denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE)] of bacterial communities from dunes invaded by C. edulis. Saline solution consistently increased bacterial cells detected by cytometry (P {$\leq$} 0.001). Principal component analysis suggested a limited temporal framework (0--24 h) in which community function can be explored without significant alterations in C substrate consumption. Changes under C. edulis invasion exhibited a different pattern of C substrate utilization comparing native and non-native zones (interspecific), but also between native zones (intraspecific), suggesting that functional impacts are site-dependent. Complementary, results obtained from PCR-DGGE indicated that the bacterial community structure of native dunes significantly differed from dunes invaded by C. edulis.},

This study investigates the macroinvertebrate community structure of five conservation ponds south of Karlsruhe, Germany, to identify effects caused by this invasive crayfish. Two of the ponds had a high population density of F. immunis, two were expected to have lower crayfish densities as they had been habitat modified with gravelled water beds as a crayfish management approach, and one pond was known to be free of crayfish but contained fish. The macroinvertebrate communities were analyzed considering their species richness and composition. The relative density of F. immunis within the samples was regarded as a representative indicator for crayfish population density and tested for its influence on the ordination along with habitat composition and abiotic factors using distance-based redundancy analysis. F. immunis was identified as a driving factor of the macroinvertebrate communities of sampled ponds. Additionally, this study indicates that gravelling ground beds as a management method for invasive burrowing crayfish species does not significantly influence the community composition but can minimize indirect effects caused by F. immunis.},

@article{sahadeClimateChangeGlacier2015,
    abstract = {The Antarctic Peninsula (AP) is one of the three places on Earth that registered the most intense warming in the last 50 years, almost five times the global mean. This warming has strongly affected the cryosphere, causing the largest ice-shelf collapses ever observed and the retreat of 87\% of glaciers. Ecosystem responses, although increasingly predicted, have been mainly reported for pelagic systems. However, and despite most Antarctic species being benthic, responses in the Antarctic benthos have been detected in only a few species, and major effects at assemblage level are unknown. This is probably due to the scarcity of baselines against which to assess change. We performed repeat surveys of coastal benthos in 1994, 1998, and 2010, analyzing community structure and environmental variables at King George Island, Antarctica. We report a marked shift in an Antarctic benthic community that can be linked to ongoing climate change. However, rather than temperature as the primary factor, we highlight the resulting increased sediment runoff, triggered by glacier retreat, as the potential causal factor. The sudden shift from a ``filter feeders--ascidian domination'' to a ``mixed assemblage'' suggests that thresholds (for example, of tolerable sedimentation) and alternative equilibrium states, depending on the reversibility of the changes, could be possible traits of this ecosystem. Sedimentation processes will be increasing under the current scenario of glacier retreat, and attention needs to be paid to its effects along the AP.},

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures.

The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult.

@incollection{terbraakTheoryGradientAnalysis2004,
    abstract = {This chapter concerns data analysis techniques that assist the interpretation of community composition in terms of species' responses to environmental gradients in the broadest sense. All species occur in a characteristic, limited range of habitats; and within their range, they tend to be most abundant around their particular environmental optimum. The composition of biotic communities thus changes along environmental gradients. Direct gradient analysis is a regression problem---fitting curves or surfaces to the relation between each species' abundance, probability of occurrence, and one or more environmental variables. Ecologists have independently developed a variety of alternative techniques. Many of these techniques are essentially heuristic, and have a less secure theoretical basis. This chapter presents a theory of gradient analysis, in which the heuristic techniques are integrated with regression, calibration, ordination and constrained ordination as distinct, well-defined statistical problems. The various techniques used for each type of problem are classified in families according to their implicit response model and the method used to estimate parameters of the model. Three such families are considered. The treatment shown here unites such apparently disparate data analysis techniques as linear regression, principal components analysis, redundancy analysis, Gaussian ordination, weighted averaging, reciprocal averaging, detrended correspondence analysis, and canonical correspondence analysis in a single theoretical framework.},

We defend detrended correspondence analysis by theoretical arguments and by reanalyzing data that previously gave bad results. We show by examples that constrained ordination can yield more informative views on effects of interest compared to unconstrained ordination (where such effects can be invisible) and show how constrained axes can be interpreted. Constrained ordination uses an ANOVA/regression approach to enable the user to focus on particular aspects of species community data, in particular the effects of qualitative and quantitative environmental variables. We close with an analysis examining the interaction effects between two factors, and we demonstrate how principal response curves can help in their visualisation.

It is shown that distance-based analyses make implicit assumptions that are typically out-of-step with what is observed in real data, which has major consequences. 4. Potential consequences of this mean--variance misspecification are: confounding location and dispersion effects in ordinations; misleading results when trying to identify taxa in which an effect is expressed; failure to detect a multivariate effect unless it is expressed in high-variance taxa. 5.

Recent advances in statistical modelling mean that it is now possible to build models that are appropriate for the data which address key ecological questions in a statistically coherent manner. Key advantages of this approach include interpretability, flexibility, and efficiency, which we explain in detail and illustrate by example. The steps in a model-based approach to analysis are outlined, with an emphasis on key features arising in a multivariate context. A key distinction in the model-based approach is the emphasis on diagnostic checking to ensure that the model provides reasonable agreement with the observed data. Two examples are presented that illustrate how the model-based approach can provide insights into ecological problems not previously available. In the first example, we test for a treatment effect in a study where different sites had different sampling intensities, which was handled by adding an offset term to the model. In the second example, we incorporate trait information into a model for ordinal response in order to identify the main reasons why species differ in their environmental response.},

    abstract = {Ecological data sets often record the abundance of species, together with a set of explanatory variables. Multivariate statistical methods are optimal to analyze such data and are thus frequently used in ecology for exploration, visualization, and inference. Most approaches are based on pairwise distance matrices instead of the sites-by-species matrix, which stands in stark contrast to univariate statistics, where data models, assuming specific distributions, are the norm. However, through advances in statistical theory and computational power, models for multivariate data have gained traction. Systematic simulation-based performance evaluations of these methods are important as guides for practitioners but still lacking. Here, we compare two model-based methods, multivariate generalized linear models (MvGLMs) and constrained quadratic ordination (CQO), with two distance-based methods, distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). We studied the performance of the methods to discriminate between causal variables and noise variables for 190 simulated data sets covering different sample sizes and data distributions. MvGLM and dbRDA differentiated accurately between causal and noise variables. The former had the lowest false-positive rate (0.008), while the latter had the lowest false-negative rate (0.027). CQO and CCA had the highest false-negative rate (0.291) and false-positive rate (0.256), respectively, where these error rates were typically high for data sets with linear responses. Our study shows that both model- and distance-based methods have their place in the ecologist's statistical toolbox. MvGLM and dbRDA are reliable for analyzing species--environment relations, whereas both CQO and CCA exhibited considerable flaws, especially with linear environmental gradients.},

    abstract = {The mean-variance relationship is a central property of multivariate abundances -- it has been shown that when not accounted for, potentially serious artifacts can be introduced to analyses. One such effect is the confounding of location and dispersion. Roberts (in press) recently argued that mean-variance relationships are not important in understanding properties of distance-based analyses, and that row standardisation fixes the problem of apparent location-dispersion confounding. We use simulation to disprove both statements. In situations where there is a shift in total abundance from one location to the next, the effects of location-dispersion confounding can be considerable. But we also show that even if there is no systematic difference in total abundance between two communities, and no change in dispersion, distance-based analysis may falsely claim that there is a change. We agree that multivariate abundance data are hierarchical, and that it is helpful to study effects at both the species-level and the community level. However, disentangling species-level from community-level effects is not possible without a hierarchical method of analysis. Recently proposed model-based approaches to ordination offer a way forward to resolve the issues discussed here.},

Methods of unconstrained ordination currently used, such as non-metric multidimensional scaling, are algorithm-based techniques developed and implemented without directly accommodating the statistical properties of the data at hand. Failure to account for these key data properties can lead to misleading results. A model-based approach to unconstrained ordination can address this issue, and in this study, two types of models for ordination are proposed based on finite mixture models and latent variable models. Each method is capable of handling different data types and different forms of species response to latent gradients. Further strengths of the models are demonstrated via example and simulation. Advantages of model-based approaches to ordination include the following: residual analysis tools for checking assumptions to ensure the fitted model is appropriate for the data; model selection tools to choose the most appropriate model for ordination; methods for formal statistical inference to draw conclusions from the ordination; and improved efficiency, that is model-based ordination better recovers true relationships between sites, when used appropriately.},

The r package gllvm offers relatively fast methods to fit GLLVMs via maximum likelihood, along with tools for model checking, visualization and inference. The main advantage of the package over other implementations is speed, for example, being two orders of magnitude faster, and capable of handling thousands of response variables. These advances come from using variational approximations to simplify the likelihood expression to be maximized, automatic differentiation software for model-fitting (via the TMB package) and careful choice of initial values for parameters. Examples are used to illustrate the main features and functionality of the package, such as constrained or unconstrained ordination, including functional traits in `fourth corner' models, and (if the number of environmental coefficients is not large) make inferences about environmental associations.},

    abstract = {Community ecology aims to understand what factors determine the assembly and dynamics of species assemblages at different spatiotemporal scales. To facilitate the integration between conceptual and statistical approaches in community ecology, we propose Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) as a general, flexible framework for modern analysis of community data. While non-manipulative data allow for only correlative and not causal inference, this framework facilitates the formulation of data-driven hypotheses regarding the processes that structure communities. We model environmental filtering by variation and covariation in the responses of individual species to the characteristics of their environment, with potential contingencies on species traits and phylogenetic relationships. We capture biotic assembly rules by species-to-species association matrices, which may be estimated at multiple spatial or temporal scales. We operationalise the HMSC framework as a hierarchical Bayesian joint species distribution model, and implement it as R- and Matlab-packages which enable computationally efficient analyses of large data sets. Armed with this tool, community ecologists can make sense of many types of data, including spatially explicit data and time-series data. We illustrate the use of this framework through a series of diverse ecological examples.},

@article{vanderveenConcurrentOrdinationSimultaneous2023,
    abstract = {In community ecology, unconstrained ordination can be used to indirectly explore drivers of community composition, while constrained ordination can be used to directly relate predictors to an ecological community. However, existing constrained ordination methods do not explicitly account for community composition that cannot be explained by the predictors, so that they have the potential to misrepresent community composition if not all predictors are available in the data. We propose and develop a set of new methods for ordination and joint species distribution modelling (JSDM) as part of the generalized linear latent variable model (GLLVM) framework, that incorporate predictors directly into an ordination. This includes a new ordination method that we refer to as concurrent ordination, as it simultaneously constructs unconstrained and constrained latent variables. Both unmeasured residual covariation and predictors are incorporated into the ordination by simultaneously imposing reduced rank structures on the residual covariance matrix and on fixed-effects. We evaluate the method with a simulation study, and show that the proposed developments outperform canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) for Poisson and Bernoulli responses, and perform similar to redundancy analysis (RDA) for normally distributed responses, the two most popular methods for constrained ordination in community ecology. Two examples with real data further demonstrate the benefits of concurrent ordination, and the need to account for residual covariation in the analysis of multivariate data. This article contextualizes the role of constrained ordination in the GLLVM and JSDM frameworks, while developing a new ordination method that incorporates the best of unconstrained and constrained ordination, and which overcomes some of the deficiencies of existing classical ordination methods.},

@article{nikuAnalyzingEnvironmentaltraitInteractions2021,
    abstract = {In ecological community studies it is often of interest to study the effect of species related trait variables on abundances or presence-absences. Specifically, the interest may lay in the interactions between environmental and trait variables. An increasingly popular approach for studying such interactions is to use the so-called fourth-corner model, which explicitly posits a regression model where the mean response of each species is a function of interactions between covariate and trait predictors (among other terms). On the other hand, many of the fourth-corner models currently applied in the literature are too simplistic to properly account for variation in environmental and trait response and any residual covariation between species. To overcome this problem, we propose a fourth-corner latent variable model which combines the following three features: latent variables to capture the correlation between species, fourth-corner terms to account for environment-trait interactions, and species-specific random slopes for modeling excess heterogeneity between species in their environmental response. We perform an extensive numerical study comparing a variety of fourth-corner models available in the literature which account for the aforementioned sources of variation to varying degrees. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed fourth-corner latent variable models performed well when testing for the fourth-corner (interaction) coefficients, across both Type I error and power. By comparison, some models that do not full account for all relevant sources of variation suffer from inflated Type I error leading to potentially misleading inference. The proposed method is illustrated by an example on ground beetle data.},

Our algorithm makes these tools generally available to analysts of discrete data and can combine any likelihood-based covariance modeling method for Gaussian data with any set of discrete marginal distributions. Previously, tools for discrete data were generally specific to one family of distributions or covariance modeling paradigm, or otherwise did not exist. Our algorithm is more flexible than alternate methods, takes advantage of existing fast algorithms for Gaussian data, and simulations suggest that it outperforms competing graphical modeling and factor analysis procedures for count and binomial data. We additionally show that in a Gaussian copula graphical model with discrete margins, conditional independence relationships in the latent Gaussian variables are inherited by the discrete observations. Our method is illustrated with a graphical model and factor analysis on an overdispersed ecological count dataset of species abundances.},

@article{dexterTroubleStressFlexible2018,
    abstract = {Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) is a powerful statistical tool which enables complex multivariate data sets to be visualized in a reduced number of dimensions. Users typically evaluate the fit of an NMDS ordination via ordination ``stress'' (i.e., data distortion) against a commonly accepted set of heuristic guidelines. However, these guidelines do not account for the mathematical relationship which links ordination stress to sample size. Consequently, researchers working with large data sets may unnecessarily present ordinations in an intractable number of dimensions, subdivide their data, or forego the use of NMDS entirely and lose the benefits of this highly flexible and useful technique. In order to overcome the limitations of these practices, we advocate for an alternative approach to the evaluation of NMDS ordination fit via the usage of permutation-based ecological null models. We present the rationale for this approach from a theoretical basis, supported by a brief literature review, and an example usage of the methodology. Our literature review shows that NMDS analyses often far exceed the number of observations under which the original stress guidelines were formulated---with a significant increasing trend in recent decades. Adoption of a permutation-based approach will consequently provide a more flexible and quantitative evaluation of NMDS fit and allow for the continued application of NMDS in an era of increasingly large datasets.},

Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

    abstract = {Multiple ecological drivers, along with forest age, determine the species composition of boreal forest ecosystems. However, the role of age in successional changes in forests cannot be understood without taking site conditions, the disturbance regime and forest structure into account. In this study, we ask two research questions: 1. What is the relationship between forest age and overall species composition in older near-natural spruce forests, i.e. forests of age beyond harvest maturity? 2. Do species associated with different forest habitats respond similarly to variation in forest age? Data were collected in 257 Norway spruce dominated 0.25\,ha plots from three study areas in Southeastern and Central Norway. Species inventories were conducted for lichens and bryophytes on trees and rocks, vascular plants on the forest floor, and for deadwood-associated bryophytes and polypore fungi. Although NMDS ordination analyses of the total species composition identified a main axis related to the age of the oldest trees in two of the study areas, variation partitioning analyses showed that age explained a small fraction of variation of the species composition compared to site conditions, logging history, forest structure, and differences between the sites in all habitats. The unique variation explained by forest age species was, however, significant for all habitats. The fraction of variation in species composition explained by forest age was the largest for lichens and bryophytes on trees, and for deadwood-associated bryophytes and polypore fungi. Our results suggest that practical mapping of near-natural forests for management purposes inventories should include site conditions, forest structure and between site differences in addition to forest age.},

The aim of this study is to assess the potential sensitivity of springtail assemblages to climate change by presenting some of the first data on the elevation stratification of springtail assemblages in subtropical rainforest. A standardised sampling protocol was used to compare the assemblages of families and species of springtails living within leaf-litter at three elevations in continuous rainforest in south-east Queensland, Australia. Leaf-litter was collected and springtails extracted from four replicate plots at approximately 700, 900 and 1100 m a.s.l. on two sampling occasions (January 2008 and December 2008). Environment variables (elevation of plots, tree species richness, composition and basal area, soil temperature and moisture and a range of physical and chemical properties of the soil) that may correlate with springtail distributions were incorporated into the analyses. Springtail assemblages showed clear elevation patterns, despite some differences between the two sampling occasions. Springtail assemblages characteristic of different elevations particularly when examined at a finer taxonomic resolution (species compared with family-level identification) were identified. Plot elevation (m a.s.l.) correlated most strongly with patterns in springtail species assemblages, but was also highly correlated with several other environmental factors. The results indicate that springtails, as a group, respond strongly to the physico-chemical and/or biological changes that occur with increasing elevation, even over a relatively small elevation range, demonstrating that they have potential as monitoring targets as forests experience climate change.},

@article{muldersIntergradingReefCommunities2022,
    abstract = {Temperate reefs are increasingly affected by the direct and indirect effects of climate change. At many of their warm range edges, cool-water kelps are decreasing, while seaweeds with warm-water affinities are increasing. These habitat-forming species provide different ecological functions, and shifts to warm-affinity seaweeds are expected to modify the structure of associated communities. Predicting the nature of such shifts at the ecosystem level is, however, challenging, as they often occur gradually over large geographical areas. Here, we take advantage of a climatic transition zone, where cool-affinity (kelp) and warm-affinity (Sargassum) seaweed forests occur adjacently under similar environmental conditions, to test whether these seaweed habitats support different associated seaweed, invertebrate, coral, and fish assemblages. We found clear differences in associated seaweed assemblages between habitats characterized by kelp and Sargassum abundance, with kelp having higher biomass and seaweed diversity and more cool-affinity species than Sargassum habitats. The multivariate invertebrate and fish assemblages were not different between habitats, despite a higher diversity of fish species in the Sargassum habitat. No pattern in temperature affinity of the invertebrate or fish assemblages in each habitat was found, and few fish species were exclusive to one habitat or the other. These findings suggest that, as ocean warming continues to replace kelps with Sargassum, the abundance and diversity of associated seaweeds could decrease, whereas fish could increase. Nevertheless, the more tropicalized seaweed habitats may provide a degree of functional redundancy to associated fauna in temperate seaweed habitats.},

    abstract = {Gut microbiota is associated with host health and its environmental adaption, influenced by seasonal variation. Pomacea canaliculata is one of the world's 100 worst invasive alien species. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to analyze the seasonal variation of gut microbiota of P. canaliculata. The results suggested that the predominant gut microbial phyla of P. canaliculata included Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, which helped digest plant food and accumulate energy. The gut microbiota of P. canaliculata in summer group showed the highest diversity, whereas the winter group possessed the lowest, probably due to the shortage of food resources of P. canaliculata in winter. Principal coordinate analysis analysis based on unweighted unifrac and weighted unifrac indicated that the composition of gut microbiota of P. canaliculata significantly varied across seasons. Bacteroidetes tended to be enriched in summer by linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis. Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria were extremely abundant in autumn, while Fusobacteria and Cetobacterium enriched in winter. In conclusion, the structure of the gut microbiota of P. canaliculata was significantly different among seasons, which was beneficial to the environment adaptation and the digestion and metabolism of food during different periods.},

    abstract = {Riparian soils, together with vegetation, play a crucial role in supporting biodiversity and driving biogeochemical processes within river ecosystems. Conservation of riparian soils and artificial planting are essential for river ecosystem recovery following land degradation. Researchers focus on examining soil nutrients, microbial biomass, and organic acid metabolism in the interactions between plants and soil along riverbanks. However, the seasonal responses of riparian soils to artificial plantations have been infrequently reported in the existing literature. This study investigates the influence of seasonal variations on soil conditions and the growth of artificially planted species in the riparian zones of the Three Gorges Dam Reservoir (TGDR) in China. The species sampled include Cynodon dactylon, Hemarthria altissima, and Salix matsudana. These species provide valuable insight into soil properties along riparian zones, assessing interactions across different seasons: T1 (spring), T2 (summer), and T3 (autumn). The results demonstrated significant seasonal changes in soil organic matter, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and other indicators between T1 and T3. Apart from invertase activity in H. altissima soil, enzyme activity peaked during T1. Dominant soil bacteria were examined using high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing, revealing that the available bacteria belong to 62 phyla and 211 classes. Among the most abundant were Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, averaging over 60\,\% across all soil samples. Principal component analyses accounted for 62.81\,\% (T1), 50.57\,\% (T2), and 54.08\,\% (T3) of the variation observed in the study, indicating that soil properties were predominantly influenced by the different seasonal phases, assuming all other factors remained constant. Pearson correlation analysis (p {$<$} 0.05) identified strong positive correlations between physical properties and all three plant species during T1 (r {$\leq$} 0.94), as well as significant negative correlations with bacterial communities in T2 and T3 (r {$\leq$} -1.00). These findings suggest that the selected plant species are well-suited to cultivation in the riparian zone of the TGDR. This study enhances our understanding of seasonal dynamics in riparian environments, offering practical insights into their management.},

Despite the great significance of the WMPs, there remains a significant gap in understanding the ecological determinants influencing their spatial variations, particularly within the context of botanical and/or ethnobotanical assessments conducted in specific study areas. In this study, we utilized phytosociological principles to investigate the impact of ecological factors on the community types of WMPs in Ada'a district. Through stratified random sampling, data were collected from 59 plots, encompassing both ethnomedicinal flora and environmental parameters. The result of `clara' partitioning method revealed six distinct community types of WMPs which have significant differences (Cophenetic correlation coefficient~=~0.801, P~{$<~$}0.001) among themselves. Moreover, the Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) identified elevation, sand, organic matter (OM), phosphorus (P), and grazing as primary factors that influenc the spatial variations in species composition of the medicinal plants. The study provides vital insights into the diversity and spatial dynamics of wild medicinal plants in Ada'a district, emphasizing the need for conservation efforts. We recommend prioritizing in-situ conservation in highland forests and wetland areas as they are recognized as key habitats for diverse medicinal plant resources so as to ensure sustainable utilization.},

    abstract = {Seed dispersal is a key process that influences the recruitment of plant species, yielding profound consequences on vegetation structure. This process can be affected by environmental disturbances, such as fires, leading to varied impacts on the agents involved, both dispersers and plants. We investigated the potential role of small mammals (rodents and marsupials) as seed dispersers in a Neotropical savanna (Brazilian Cerrado). We also evaluated the impact of fire severity on the seed dispersal services provided by these animals in gallery forests, 3 years after a major fire event. We live-trapped small mammals in 14 sites, 7 of which were located in forests classified in three categories of fire severity (``unburned'', ``low severity'', or ``moderate severity''). We captured 13 mammal species, finding a total of 11,688 seeds in their feces (collected inside traps or handling bags). These seeds encompassed 28 plant species from at least 8 families. A multivariate analysis (NMDS) revealed differences among small mammal species in terms of potentially dispersed plants, with seeds of 18 plant species being consumed by no more than one small mammal species. An increase in fire severity affected the composition of plant species potentially dispersed, changed the relative role of forest small mammals as seed dispersers, and decreased observed richness of defecated seeds. We conclude that high-severity wildfires affect highly relevant ecological processes, such as seed dispersal by animals. These effects could impact the recruitment dynamics of plant species and, consequently, the vegetation recovery and plant community composition in fire-affected areas.

    abstract = {Agricultural expansion and intensification are major drivers of global change. Quantifying the importance of different processes governing the assembly of local communities in agroecosystems is essential to guide the conservation effort allocated to enhancing habitat connectivity, improving habitat quality or managing species interactions. We used multiple detection methods to record the occurrence of medium-sized and large-sized mammals in three managed landscapes of a heterogeneous Mediterranean region. Then we used a joint species distribution model to evaluate the relative influence of dispersal limitation, environmental filtering, and interspecific interactions on the local assembly of mammal communities in 4-km2 plots. The partitioning of the explained variation in species occurrence was attributed on average 99\% to environmental filters and 1\% to dispersal filters. No role was attributed to biotic filters, in agreement with the scarce support for strong competition or other negative interactions found after a literature review. Four principal environmental factors explained on average 63\% of variance in species occurrence and operated mainly at the landscape scale. The amount of shrub cover in the neighboring landscape was the most influential factor favoring mammal occurrence and accounted for nearly one-third of the total variance. The proportion of intensively managed croplands and proxies of human activity within landscape samples limited mammal presence. At the microhabitat scale ( 80 m2 plots) the mean percentage area deprived of woody vegetation also had a negative effect. Functional traits such as body mass or social behavior accounted for a substantial fraction of the variation attributed to environmental factors. We concluded that multiscale environmental filtering governed local community assembly, whereas the role of dispersal limitation and interspecific interactions was negligible. Our results suggest that further removal of shrubland, the expansion of intensive agriculture, and the increase of human activity are expected to result in species losses. The fact that community integrity responds to a single type of ecological process simplifies practical recommendations. Management strategies should focus on the conservation and restoration of shrubland, adopting alternatives to intensive schemes of agricultural production, and minimizing recreational and other human activities in remnant natural habitats within agroecosystems or mosaic landscapes.},

Understanding the factors that determine the abundance and distribution of species is a fundamental goal of ecology, however, there is a lack of understanding of how degradation affects the deterministic processes that determine community structure and species composition. Here, we used the Hierarchical Model of Species Communities (HMSC) to explore how degradation affects environmental filtering and biotic interactions processes in Hulun Buir Steppe. The results showed that (1) The sensitivity of species to environmental change increases with deeper degradation. At the same time most of the species show some adaptation to environmental changes in the moderately and severely degraded stages. (2) Correlation between species traits and environmental variables weakened with deeper degradation. (3) Species interactions decrease significantly with increasing degradation and are typically dominated by positive interactions in severely degraded stages. Species interactions affected by degradation may be characterized by a shift from positive to negative interactions, the disappearance of negative interactions, and a decrease in both positive and negative interactions. The application of joint species distribution modeling to evaluate the impact of degradation on environmental filtering and biotic interactions in steppe community reassembly is a new perspective that offers valuable insights for restoration decisions in degraded steppes.},

    abstract = {National Park Service units in the United States play a large role in providing habitat for native pollinators. In parks that are established to preserve cultural landscapes, park managers recognize an opportunity to improve pollinator habitat while maintaining historically accurate conditions. In this study, we document floral resources and native bees within managed park grasslands, with the goal of providing information to managers to help them maximize pollinator habitat while meeting other management objectives. The study was performed on 37 grassland properties in the mid-Atlantic region of the eastern United States, distributed across four parks; each property was managed with one of three management types: cool-season hayed, cool-season pasture, or warm-season meadows managed with multiple approaches. We surveyed bees and open flowers on 50-m transects twice each year in 2021 and 2022. Repeated-measures ANOVA models revealed that mean bee abundance, richness, evenness, and diversity did not vary among sites or management types. This finding was further supported by a principal coordinates analysis that showed that bee community composition was similar across management types. Nonetheless, we found evidence to indicate that the three management types did not produce equivalent habitat for bees. Species accumulation curves showed that the effective number of flower species was consistently lower in cool-season pastures, relative to the other two management types. Furthermore, we detected positive correlations between bee and flower diversity metrics in one of the 2 years, indicating that floral metrics are associated with bee communities, at least under certain conditions. Collectively, our study suggests that cool-season fields that are hayed and warm-season meadows have higher floral diversity than cool-season pastures within national park units of the mid-Atlantic region, and this higher diversity of forbs has the potential to benefit native bee diversity.},

    abstract = {Agricultural management has a great influence on biodiversity and its services in agroecosystems. In Europe, a relevant proportion of biodiversity is dependent on low-input agriculture. To assess the effects of agricultural management on biodiversity, in this study we surveyed the communities of arable plants, diurnal flying insects, and pollinators in three conventional and in two organic fields of a traditional Elephant garlic (Allium ampeloprasum L.) crop of the Valdichiana area, in Tuscany (central Italy). The sampling was carried out twice during the season: in spring, during crop growing, and in summer, after crop harvesting. We assessed the effects of the different agricultural management on the richness and composition (species occurrence and abundance) of the three communities using univariate and multivariate analyses. Concerning our specific case study,~only plant species richness was significantly higher in organic fields (15.7\,{\textpm}\,2.7 species per plot), compared to conventional ones (5.4\,{\textpm}\,2.3 species per plot). Regarding community composition, only pollinators showed a marginally significant difference between conventional and organic fields. Conversely, the effect of specific fields significantly explained differences in composition of all the investigated groups (plants, total insects, and~pollinators). The results suggest that, in our case study, the emerged differences in diversity of the investigated communities were mainly attributable to environmental and management factors related to single fields, more than to organic or conventional farming. Such evidence could be partly due to the very local scale of the study, to the heterogeneity of the surveyed fields, and to the reduced number of surveyed fields. Further investigation is therefore needed.},

@article{graserLargescaleForestDisturbance2025,
    abstract = {In Central Europe, natural forest disturbance is increasing due to climate change and the legacies of past forest management. The resulting early successional forest stages shape habitat conditions and availability for forest-dwelling species. How disturbance, pre-disturbance forest management such as beech underplanting in conifer stands and post-disturbance management, such as salvage logging, shape biodiversity is poorly understood. In a large field study, we quantified how the large-scale loss of mature spruce plantations after natural disturbance affects bird diversity and abundance in Central Europe and how this is moderated by pre- and post- disturbance management. In a Bayesian community distance sampling approach, we conducted field surveys on 182 plots in a stratified design, comparing bark beetle and windthrow disturbances as well as two management treatments, (i) underplanting with beech before the disturbance occurred versus no underplanting and (ii) salvage logging versus no post-disturbance logging. We used undisturbed mature spruce plantations as a control. Bird diversity was higher in disturbed forests than in undisturbed spruce plantations and was affected little by management. Bayesian community distance sampling models revealed that responses were highly species-specific: shrub-associated birds profited from disturbance in general and reached highest densities where beech had been planted under the spruce canopy before the disturbance occurred, whereas open-habitat and farmland birds reached higher densities on salvage-logged sites. Only few typical species of coniferous forests persisted at disturbed sites. Synthesis and applications. With increasing forest disturbance, pre- and post-disturbance management can promote target bird species. Shrub-associated species can be promoted by underplanting, open habitat-adapted species by salvage logging and species depending on vertical structures by no intervention. For maximising biodiversity benefits at a landscape scale, underrepresented management practices (no intervention) should be promoted to ensure a balanced forest management and to maintain diverse post-disturbance bird communities.},

    abstract = {Plantation forests constitute a significant amount of the wooded area in many parts of the globe. However, the extent of biological provision conferred by plantation forest depends on regional conservation priorities and biogeographical context. Here, we evaluate the arthropod biodiversity in a chronosequence of pine plantation (clear-felled, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 21-years) in the largest lowland conifer forest in the UK. We compare the assemblage within 37 plantation stands and eight important open habitat remnants in a formerly heathland dominated region. We also assess the configuration and potential isolation of ephemeral open early growth stage habitat across a 60-year plantation rotation. Carabid and spider assemblages changed throughout the sampled chronosequence. In the early growth stages (1--7 years) before canopy closure, arthropod assemblages contained many individuals and species associated with dry-open habitats, greater numbers of rare species than closed canopy plantation and had similar composition (non-metric multidimensional scaling) to heathland samples. Early growth stages and heathlands primarily differed in the additional presence of generalist species in the plantation. Species associated with woodland increased in abundance as the plantation aged, but remained far less numerous than dry-open or generalist species. The spatial distribution of young growth stages across the rotation cycle was significantly clustered in the early and late rotation phases. Plantation landscapes often support high species richness but we highlight their value for vulnerable heathland biodiversity early in the rotation cycle. To increase plantation value regional conservation priorities should be supported with appropriate consideration of growth stage configuration across the full rotation.},

@article{huFungalCompositionAssociated2024,
    abstract = {Fungi are key decomposers of deadwood, but the impact of anthropogenic changes in nutrients and temperature on fungal community and its consequences for wood microbial respiration are not well understood. Here, we examined how nitrogen and phosphorus additions (field experiment) and warming (laboratory experiment) together influence fungal composition and microbial respiration from decomposing wood of angiosperms and gymnosperms in a subtropical forest. Nutrient additions significantly increased wood microbial respiration via fungal composition, but effects varied with nutrient types and taxonomic groups. Specifically, phosphorus addition significantly increased wood microbial respiration (65\%) through decreased acid phosphatase activity and increased abundance of fast-decaying fungi (e.g., white rot), while nitrogen addition marginally increased it (30\%). Phosphorus addition caused a greater increase in microbial respiration in gymnosperms than in angiosperms (83.3\% vs. 46.9\%), which was associated with an increase in Basidiomycota:Ascomycota operational taxonomic unit abundance in gymnosperms but a decrease in angiosperms. The temperature dependencies of microbial respiration were remarkably constant across nutrient levels, consistent with metabolic scaling theory hypotheses. This is because there was no significant interaction between temperature and wood phosphorus availability or fungal composition, or the interaction among the three factors. Our results highlight the key role of tree identity in regulating nutrient response of wood microbial respiration through controlling fungal composition. Given that the range of angiosperm species may expand under climate warming and forest management, our data suggest that expansion will decrease nutrient effects on forest carbon cycling in forests previously dominated by gymnosperm species.},

    abstract = {Optimal efficiency in ecological restoration of degraded ecosystems in the Amazon has become a demand of global interest. The objective of this study was to investigate the trajectory of ecosystems under restoration in two (PL2) and seven (PL7) years since the initial seedling planting with tree species after bauxite mining in Eastern Amazon, Brazil. Soil's physical and chemical parameters (organic matter, bulk density, porosity, infiltration, and fertility) and attributes of the established vegetation (abundance of individuals and families, Hill numbers - H0, H1, and H2, non-metric multidimensional scaling - nMDS and distance-based redundancy analysis - dbRDA) were assessed. Planting seven-year-old seedlings led to the establishment of vegetation with diversity metrics comparable to those of the reference forest, particularly in the upper vegetation stratum. However, this ecosystem has not improved the soil's physical quality and did not promote increase in organic matter in relation to the 2-year-old seedling planting restoration ecosystem. This was mainly due to inadequate operational procedures, such as the control of regenerating plants, terrain reconstruction with moist substrate, and the use of some non-adapted tree species in the initial seedling planting. Restoring areas need to be monitored and restoration methods and procedures reviewed in order to optimize restoration processes after bauxite mining in the Amazon.},

    abstract = {Industrialization has ushered in massive changes in agriculture. Particularly in low mountain ranges, large-scale afforestation with Norway spruce on traditionally managed, semi-natural grasslands has caused a severe decline in biodiversity. Tree removal, hay transfer and resumption of grazing or mowing are typical measures to re-create species-rich grasslands. The aim of this study was to use vascular plants and three insect taxa (leafhoppers, true bugs and grasshoppers) as bioindicators to evaluate the success of montane grassland restoration on former spruce forests in Central Europe. In addition, we intended to identify the drivers of species richness within the studied grasslands in order to derive suitable recommendations for habitat management. We analyzed two different treatments: (i) grazed restoration sites where trees had been cut and species-rich green hay had been applied (N = 9) and (ii) target sites with a long continuity of low-intensity grazing (N = 9).Our study revealed that all studied taxa responded rapidly to the restoration measures. After a development period of three to five years, we found no differences in species richness and diversity of leafhoppers, true bugs and grasshoppers (all, target and threatened species). In addition, non-metric multidimensional scaling showed a large overlap in species composition between restoration and target grasslands. Among target and threatened species, vascular plants displayed the same pattern as insects and reached similar values when comparing the two treatments. However, total species richness and diversity of vascular plants were still higher on the target sites and species composition overlapped only partially. Grazing intensity was the predictor with the highest explanatory power in multivariable (Generalized) Linear Mixed-effects Models, being negatively related to species richness of leafhoppers and true bugs. We conclude that the measures implemented were effective in re-establishing target communities of different taxa. The transfer of seed-containing hay enabled or accelerated the development of the vegetation. Insects, on the other hand, were able to recolonize the restored grasslands on their own, given that these sites were embedded in a network of species-rich grasslands. With regard to insects (e.g., leafhoppers and true bugs), it should be ensured that grazing is applied at low intensity.},

    abstract = {To help upscale ecological restoration of degraded lands, landscape factors and longer time scales should be considered when assessing restoration efforts. We evaluated the impact of initial restoration intervention, landscape composition, and elapsed time since the restoration began on the long-term progress of Pannonic sand grassland restoration. Treatments (seeding, mowing, and carbon amendment) were implemented for 6--7~years and monitoring lasted up to 23~years after the first treatment applications in eight experimental blocks belonging to three field experiments. The abundance of target/neophyte species, and distance from primary grasslands and plantations (as major source of target/neophyte species) were estimated in 500~m landscape buffers around each block to characterize landscape composition. Restoration progress was calculated as the difference between the relative cover of target/neophyte species in treatment and control plots. Restoration intervention and neophyte abundance in the landscape had a significant effect on the restoration progress, but time did not. Seeding had the highest positive effect on target species and also prevented invasion by neophyte species. Higher abundance of neophytes in the landscape and the proximity to plantations increased the cover of neophytes in treatment plots. We conclude that restoration interventions may have a greater impact on restoration progress in the longer term than landscape factors or elapsed time. Seeding proved to be the best method in restoring sand grasslands by both favoring target species and controlling invasion. From the landscape factors, the abundance of neophyte species and distance to plantations should be considered when prioritizing areas and efforts for restoration.},

We selected three annual alien plants, widespread in the riparian habitats of the Kruger National Park, South Africa: Datura innoxia, Parthenium hysterophorus, and Xanthium strumarium, to examine their potential impacts on riparian plant communities. We identified 12--13 populations for each and placed a pair of invaded and uninvaded plots in each population. Species richness, Shannon diversity, and Pielou evenness were compared between the invaded and uninvaded plots using LMM models, and species composition was compared using ordination. The invaded vegetation showed lower species richness compared to the uninvaded, with the strongest effect observed for P. hysterophorus. The invaded plots also showed lower Shannon diversity and Pielou evenness due to the presence of alien dominants. For all three invaders, the invasion resulted in changes in the composition of native vegetation. Some native plants were more frequent and abundant in the invaded vegetation, possibly due to the habitats created in sandy river beds. The native species richness decreased with increasing invader cover, but the species richness of aliens accompanying the invasive dominants was not negatively affected by their cover. Our results confirmed the negative impact of invasive aliens on native plant diversity, with the most pronounced effect by Parthenium hysterophorus invasions.},

@article{lantaDeterminantsInvasionSingle2022,
    abstract = {Invasions of alien plants pose a serious threat to native biodiversity and ecosystem processes. Forests are considered more resistant to invasion due to limited light availability in understories. However, disturbance and abiotic stress may open tree canopies and promote invasion. Their combined effects together with the resistance of resident species may determine the numbers and abundances of invasive species. Here we explore how canopy openness, water stress, and taxonomic and functional properties of resident communities affect the invasion by a frequent single invasive species (Aster lanceolatus and Impatiens parviflora) compared to that by multiple invaders in Central European lowland forests. Different abiotic factors and species-specific mechanisms of invasiveness determined the success of single versus multiple invaders. The massive spread of A. lanceolatus was associated with the long-distance seed dispersal and exploitation of available resources by fast growth resulting in formations of compact clonal patches in disturbed, open-canopy floodplain forests. The success of I. parviflora was caused by avoiding competition via tolerating less favorable conditions under the dense tree canopy on drier sandy soils. A. lanceolatus thus suppressed resident species richness, while I. parviflora spread in communities of higher functional and phylogenetic diversity. Multiple invasive species, mostly represented by subordinate species with low cover, colonized forests that were rich in resident species. We conclude that a combination of intense disturbance and stress favor the invasion of single dominant species that act as drivers of changes in native communities. Multiple invasive species colonize forests with less extreme conditions acting more as passengers who increase rather than decrease forest diversity.},

@article{reeveRareCommonAlien2022,
    abstract = {Biological invasions are a leading threat to biodiversity globally. Increasingly, ecosystems experience multiple introductions, which can have significant effects on patterns of diversity. The way these communities assemble will depend partly on whether rare and common alien species respond to environmental predictors in the same manner as rare and common native species, but this is not well understood. To examine this question across four national parks in south-eastern Australia, we sampled the understory plant community of eucalypt-dominated dry forest subject to multiple plant introductions. The drivers of diversity and turnover in alien and native species of contrasting frequency of occurrence (low, intermediate, and high) were each tested individually. We found alien species diversity and turnover were both strongly associated with abiotic conditions (e.g., soil pH), while distance had little influence because of the greater extent of occurrence and more homogeneous composition of common aliens. In contrast, native species diversity was not associated with abiotic conditions and their turnover was as strongly influenced by distance as by abiotic conditions. In both alien and native species, however, the most important predictors of turnover changed with frequency of occurrence. Although local coexistence appears to be facilitated by life history trade-offs, species richness of aliens and natives was negatively correlated and native species might face greater competition in areas with more neutral soils (e.g., pH {$>$} 5.5) where alien richness and relative frequency were both highest. We conclude that diversity and turnover in the generally more widespread alien species are mainly driven by species sorting along an environmental gradient associated with pH and nutrient availability, whereas turnover of native species is driven by more neutral processes associated with dispersal limitation. We show alien and native plant species respond to different environmental factors, as do rare and common species within each component.},

The various techniques used for each type of problem are classified into families according to their implicit response model and the method used to estimate parameters of the model. Three such families are considered. First, the family of standard statistical techniques based on the linear response model is dealt with, because they are conceptually the simplest and provide a basis for what follows, even though their ecological application is restricted. Second, a family of somewhat more complex statistical techniques are outlined which are formal extensions of the standard linear techniques and incorporate unimodal (Gaussian-like) response models explicitly. Finally, the family of heuristic techniques is considered based on weighted averaging. These are not more complex than the standard linear techniques, but implicitly fit a simple unimodal response model rather than a linear one. Ordination diagrams and their interpretation on bi plots and joint plots are also given in the chapter. This chapter has discussed which response model to choose from direct and indirect gradient analysis, and then in direct system, which one to choose from regression and constrained ordination.},

@article{terbraakCanonicalCorrespondenceAnalysis1986,
    abstract = {A new multivariate analysis technique, developed to relate community composition to known variation in the environment, is described. The technique is an extension of correspondence analysis (reciprocal averaging), a popular ordination technique that extracts continuous axes of variation from species occurrence or abundance data. Such ordination axes are typically interpreted with the help of external knowledge and data on environmental variables; this two---step approach (ordination followed by environmental gradient identification) is termed indirect gradient analysis. In the new technique, called canonical correspondence analysis, ordination axes are chosen in the light of known environmental variables by imposing the extra restriction that the axes be linear combinations of environmental variables. In this way community variation can be directly related to environmental variation. The environmental variables may be quantitative or nominal. As many axes can be extracted as there are environmental variables. The method of detrending can be incorporated in the technique to remove arch effects. (Detrended) canonical correspondence analysis is an efficient ordination technique when species have bell---shaped response curves or surfaces with respect to environmental gradients, and is therefore more appropriate for analyzing data on community composition and environmental variables than canonical correlation analysis. The new technique leads to an ordination diagram in which points represent species and sites, and vectors represent environmental variables. Such a diagram shows the patterns of variation in community composition that can be explained best by the environmental variables and also visualizes approximately the 'centers' of the species distributions along each of the environmental variables. Such diagrams effectively summarized relationships between community and environment for data sets on hunting spiders, dyke vegetation, and algae along a pollution gradient.},

Understanding how elevation, aspect, and slope influence vegetation patterns may help in predicting how climate change influences human forest usage and in developing strategies for ensuring the sustained provision of ecosystem services. However, most ecological studies have been carried out in protected areas, leaving forest areas used by humans to lesser attention. Therefore, we asked how elevation, aspect, and slope impact the vegetation on a human-influenced mountain. We measured woody vegetation size, richness, and composition on a mountain with plots set systematically in four cardinal directions at 100-m elevational intervals from the peak, from 1900 m to 4200 m above sea level, in the Hengduan Mountains in eastern Himalaya, southwestern China. We quantified how tree maximum height, basal area, aboveground biomass (AGB), tree and shrub species richness, and woody species composition changed with elevation, aspect, and slope. Based on generalized linear models, the maximum tree height, tree basal area, and woody species AGB followed a unimodal trend along elevational gradients, with tree height and basal area peaking at 3100 m, while AGB was highest at 3300 m and somewhat higher on the southern slope. Basal area increased with slope degree. Neither tree nor shrub species richness was influenced by elevation, aspect, or slope. According to canonical correspondence analysis and TWINSPAN classification, elevation and north-south orientation of the slope were major factors influencing woody species compositions, and vegetation was classified into five types of communities. Our results indicated that the influences of elevation, aspect, and slope on woody vegetation structure were similar in a human-influenced forested mountain area as in protected mountain landscapes based on the literature. However, as forests in this area are used more intensively at low and middle elevations of the southern and western slopes, where aridity restricts tree size and AGB, climate change is likely to challenge traditional harvesting practices and place pressure on moving forest usage to higher altitudes.},

    abstract = {Understanding the spatial variation in species richness and the mechanisms that limit species range sizes along geographical gradients belong to the central research issues in macroecology. Here, we aim to test the topographic and climatic effects on anuran species richness and community composition in mountainous regions in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome. We used Individual-Based Rarefaction Curve (interpolation and extrapolation), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Midpoint method and Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) to analyze the topographic and climatic effects on anuran community composition, richness, and range sizes in a global biodiversity hotspot. Our results showed that altitude and annual mean temperature and temperature seasonality were the main drivers of species altitudinal range sizes and community assembly in mountainous regions. In conclusion, Anuran community richness peaked at intermediate altitudes following thus a hump-shaped pattern and corroborated the Rapoport's altitudinal rule as range sizes increased with altitude in mountainous regions from the Atlantic Forest biome. This study revealed new insights into the patterns and drivers of Neotropical anuran communities. Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material.},

Taxa with increased localised abundances at the outfall were identified as indicators for monitoring impacts, including deposit-feeding polychaetes (Families Polygordiidae, Paraonidae and Dorvilleidae) and Phylum Nematoda.

The largest areas of tugai vegetation in Uzbekistan are preserved in the lower reaches of the Amu Dar'ya River. The main massifs of poplar forests are there. To assess their current status, 284 relev{\'e}s, representing tugai plant communities in the lower reaches of the Amu Dar'ya, have been analyzed. For each one, the position on ecological gradients was determined by species indicator values. It is shown that the scatter of relev{\'e}s is the greatest for moisture gradient: from 17 to 97 grades, and it is noticeably smaller for pasture digression (2.5--6.5) and soil salinity (16.1--19.5). To reveal the relationships between the species composition and environmental factors, CCA ordination was performed. Groups of relev{\'e}s, representing the native tugai vegetation and three ecological series connected with salinity, soil moisture, and anthropogenic pressure, are identified. According to them, four generalized plant communities, differing in species composition, floristic diversity, and structure, are distinguished. Indicator plants are identified on the basis of a formalized assessment of species constancy and importance values. The changes in species composition and structure of communities (life form spectra) are shown. It has been established that vegetation halophytization is the most active process following progressive desertification. This process is reflected in the replacement of poplar forests by shrub communities dominated by Halostachys belangeriana and Tamarix hispida. As a result of intensive anthropogenic impact, the vegetation is transformed and the importance value of ruderal annual plants becomes higher.},

    abstract = {Pollinators play pivotal roles in maintaining agricultural and natural plant communities, yet some bee populations are declining. Loss of pollinator habitats as a result of agricultural intensification and urbanization have reduced bee abundance and diversity. Additionally, climate change has affected bee distributions and led to disruption of plant-pollinator synchrony, impacting ecosystem processes. However, how these factors concurrently influence bee assemblages is poorly understood. Therefore, we evaluated bumble bee (Bombus) assemblages in relation to the proportion of agricultural, semi-natural, and urban land cover and interannual variation in temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity in Utah agroecosystems using Bombus captured as bycatch in pest monitoring traps from 2014 to 2018. Bombus assemblage composition was highest in agricultural sites with increased agricultural land cover in the surrounding area, low temperatures, and high relative humidity during the growing season; and lowest in sites with increased urban land cover, high temperatures, and low relative humidity. Functional dispersion did not differ among these groups indicating a range of tongue lengths, body sizes, hair lengths, and hair types were present within all agricultural sites. Further, high beta-diversity, as indicated by unique Bombus assemblages among sites, suggests that all agricultural sites in this study have potential conservation value for maintaining Bombus communities. Therefore, it is important that diverse habitats for pollinators are maintained through targeted management techniques. Additionally, our collection of Bombus from mid-May to mid-September identified phenological overlap within Bombus assemblages, which helps ensure pollination services are provided even if a particular species is lost due to environmental disturbances. However, while there is overlap in functional traits and phenology, considerations should be given due to widespread pollinator declines. Overall, evaluating landscape and climate variables together may yield more realistic results and better inform effective management and land-use planning strategies to prevent ecological homogenization and to foster future resiliency of Bombus populations.},

    abstract = {Urban development has drastically altered ecosystems with dramatic effects on avian diversity and community structure. Most studies investigating this phenomenon are conducted in large and established cities, with fewer conducted in areas of current urbanization. Measuring avian community structure in recently established and growing cities is necessary to understand which species are being affected in a range of urban environments. There is also a critical need to explore multiple measures of urbanization, as different axes of human influence might have varied effects on wildlife. This study investigated the relationship between avian communities and urban noise, light, and landscape composition in Weld County, CO, one of the United States' fastest growing metropolitan areas. We tested the general hypothesis that avian community assemblages would vary with multiple urban characteristics. We measured noise, light, and landscape composition across 16 sites ranging from urban to non-urban and paired these data with avian species census data. We used multivariate analyses to test for covariance of our three measures of urban characteristics, and to examine patterns of species presence and abundances at sites. Results suggest that developed land and water covary with avian community structure across our study sites. Anthropogenic noise and light did not drive avian community patterns as strongly as percent developed land and water. These three urban characteristics did not covary or form a linear urban to non-urban gradient, suggesting that urbanization can have patchy and unpredictable effects, highlighting the value of measuring urban characteristics separately.},

However, it is not yet fully understood how climate interacts with human impacts or whether the effects of these factors differ between native and alien species. Facing ongoing climate change and urbanization, we explore the effects of climate on plant species richness and composition across European cities. Location Sixty cities in Western, Central and Southern Europe. Taxon Vascular plants. Methods Species presence was recorded in seven habitats in each city. Large-scale climatic gradients were derived from 22 climatic variables using a partial principal component analysis that controlled for the effects of human population size and gross domestic product. The effects of climate and habitat type on the numbers of native and alien species were tested using linear mixed-effect models. The native and alien compositional variation across cities and habitats was analysed using principal component analysis with variation partitioning. Results The Mediterranean-to-temperate climatic gradient had a significant effect on species numbers across all habitats. The numbers of both native and alien species increased from the Mediterranean to temperate Europe. Within each city, the proportion of alien species decreased from highly urbanized to less urbanized habitats. Climate had a stronger effect on the composition of alien plants than on the composition of native plants. The native species composition especially changed from the Mediterranean to temperate cities and alien species composition also from oceanic to continental cities. Main conclusions Urban native and alien species richness follow the pattern found for the whole European flora. Based on this observation, we suggest that the future shift of warm and dry conditions from the Mediterranean to the north that is expected under global change scenarios could affect richness and change the composition of European urban floras. However, this shift would not necessarily alter the proportions of aliens.},

Site preparation prior to planting longleaf pine seedlings is often required to overcome challenges to seedling establishment on hydric sites. We know site preparation improves growth and survival of planted longleaf pine on hydric sites, but what are the impacts of site preparation on the understorey plant community? Location Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in Onslow County, NC, USA. Methods This study tested eight site preparation treatments, including an untreated control, six combinations of two vegetation control treatments (chopping or herbicide) with three soil manipulation treatments (mounding, bedding, or flat-planting [no treatment]), and a chopping--herbicide--bedding treatment. We collected data on understorey plant abundance, diversity, and composition through the first three and at 15 years after plantation establishment. We used ANOVA procedures and multivariate ordination to test for differences in understorey responses among the study treatments and through time. Results Site preparation had lasting impacts on the understorey plant community. The chop-only treatment was the only treatment that resulted in dominance of herbaceous vegetation and was among the treatments with the highest diversity and greatest abundance of Aristida stricta (wiregrass). Herbicide produced lasting reductions in Aristida stricta abundance and apparent shifts in community composition. Reduced graminoid abundance was particularly pronounced when herbicide was combined with soil manipulation treatments. Conclusions Understorey responses to site preparation through 3 years differed from responses observed in year 15, highlighting the importance of long-term monitoring. For example, herbicides controlled shrubs early, but by year 15, herbicide treatments were dominated by shrubs. Restoration scenarios often must balance ecological objectives (e.g., maintenance of a diverse understorey community) with forestry objectives (e.g., timely establishment of overstorey trees), and our findings can be used as a guide to balance these trade-offs.},

    abstract = {Questions Recent years have been characterised by extreme climate conditions. Given that high elevations are undergoing enhanced warming and alpine ecosystems provide important services, we ask: Have alpine grasslands experienced rapid vegetation changes over the last five years? Which species are more sensitive to warmer and/or drier conditions? Location Carex curvula grassland in the southern Alps (Italy). Methods Species cover was visually estimated in 20 permanent plots, including both control and climate-manipulated plots, during the period 2017--2022. Climate manipulations, that is, increased temperature and/or reduced precipitation during the snow-free period, started from 2018. Principal component analysis, redundancy analysis and generalised least-squares or linear mixed-effect models were employed to investigate variations in species assemblage and species-specific responses. Results Detectable changes were found in species cover over time and between climate manipulations, with warmed plots experiencing greater shifts in species composition compared to controls. At the species level, however, both increases and decreases in cover were observed over time, with only two non-dominant forbs, Phyteuma hemisphaericum and Leucanthemopsis alpina, showing either increased cover in warmed plots or lower cover values under drier conditions. No treatment effects and the lowest variation across years were found for the two dominant species (the sedge Carex curvula and the forb Alchemilla pentaphyllea) which together make up more than 70\% of vascular plant cover. Despite the short time period investigated, a major cover reduction was observed in all treatments for some snowbed species. Conclusions The plant species assemblage of the target alpine grassland was found to be sensitive to short-term manipulations simulating future climate changes, with individual species exhibiting idiosyncratic responses to manipulations and different cover dynamics over time. A decline in some snowbed specialists already seems to be taking place even in these late-successional grasslands --- at a rate likely to increase in the future --- with the majority of other vascular species exhibiting greater resistance to changing environmental conditions.},

Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4.

The protocol takes the investigator from study design and organization of data (formulating relevant questions, visualizing data collection, data exploration, identifying dependency), through conducting analysis (presenting, fitting and validating the model) and presenting output (numerically and visually), to extending the model via simulation. Each step includes procedures to clarify aspects of the data that affect statistical analysis, as well as guidelines for written presentation. Steps are illustrated with examples using data from the literature. Following this protocol will reduce the organization, analysis and presentation of what may be an overwhelming information avalanche into sequential and, more to the point, manageable, steps.

We assess their generality, describe what is currently known about their structure, and summarize the results of tests of the several hypotheses proposed to explain their existence. 4. The positive form generally exhibited by abundance–occupancy relationships, intraspecific or interspecific, has consequences for several areas of applied ecology, including conservation, harvesting, biological invasions and biodiversity inventorying. These implications are discussed briefly.},

@article{russellDistributionAbundanceRelations2005,
    abstract = {There are many examples in the literature of a positive correlation between the distribution of a species and its local abundance, i.e., widely occurring species tend to be more abundant locally when they do occur. Such relations have been documented over a wide range of taxa and spatial scales. There are five major hypotheses seeking to explain the relation: Random placement, Sampling error, Niche width, Demography, and Metapopulation dynamics. However, there is little evidence to distinguish between them, especially for plants. In this study, plant species presence in a short tussock grassland in inland Canterbury, New Zealand was sampled at three spatial scales (i.e. quadrat sizes; sizes of spatial grain): 0.2x0.3 m, 0.4x0.6 m, and 1.0x1.5 m, each divided into 0.1x0.15 m sub-quadrats for recording local frequency. The data were also analysed at different ranges of soil pH, water content, organic content and fertility (by bioassay). Significant positive correlations between species distribution and local abundance were found at the two larger spatial grain scales. There was no significant relation for native species, but the relation for exotic species was considerably stronger than that over all species. Reduction of environmental heterogeneity, by restricting the dataset to narrower ranges of soil factors, produced higher correlations at the two smaller grain scales. In contrast to reports in the literature, many species (most of them native) showed narrow regional distributions but high local abundance when they were at a site. It is concluded that the Sampling-error hypothesis cannot be an explanation of the results obtained here. Aspects of the results are inconsistent with the Random-placement, Demography and Niche-width hypotheses. The results are most compatible with the Metapopulation dynamics hypothesis. However, it is likely that several mechanisms are operating simultaneously. Whilst detailed analysis of empirical distributions at different spatial grains and over different ecological ranges can exclude some of the hypotheses, detailed studies of the autecology of species are the next necessary step.},

    abstract = {Questions It is well documented that invasive alien plants can reduce species richness and diversity and modify the composition of invaded communities. However, our knowledge on the impacts of invasive alien plants on the community functional structure and ecosystem properties and the mechanisms underlying these changes is more limited. We evaluated how the community functional structure and ecosystem properties change along a gradient of Ligustrum lucidum abundance. Location Subtropical mountain forest in NW Argentina. Methods We conducted tree vegetation sampling in 164 plots distributed along a gradient of L. lucidum abundance. For L. lucidum and for the most abundant tree species in these plots we estimated six functional traits (specific leaf area, leaf tensile strength, leaf nitrogen concentration, leaf water potential, wood density and maximum plant height), as well as their relative growth rates. Then, we calculated indices of community functional structure (community-weighted means for each trait; richness, evenness, divergence and dispersion). We explored the extent to which the invasive success of L. lucidum and its impact may be attributed to niche differentiation or to fitness superiority. Finally, we explored how L. lucidum abundance alters ecosystem properties. Results Some indicators of community functional structure changed linearly while others tended to saturate along the invasion gradient. L. lucidum has a higher growth rate than resident species and it lays close to the periphery, but within the limits of the functional space defined by resident trees. L. lucidum tends to displace more functionally similar resident species. Soil moisture and N content declined, while soil C:N increased with L. lucidum abundance. Conclusions Our findings suggest that both niche differentiation and fitness superiority contribute to explain the invasion success of L. lucidum and the changes in functional structure of the community along the gradient of L. lucidum abundance with evident impacts on ecosystem properties.},

Taylor's law also manifests with other seemingly disparate processes such as the transmission of infectious diseases, human sexual behavior, childhood leukemia, cancer metastases, blood flow heterogeneity, as well as with the genomic distributions of single nucleotide polymorphisms and gene structures. The theory of errors provides, through the scale invariant exponential dispersion models, a number of statistical distributions that are characterized by Taylor's law. One of these models, the scale invariant Poisson gamma (PG) distribution, has its power function exponent constrained to range between 1 and 2, as observed with many ecological systems. The PG model can be interpreted such that each quadrat would contain a random (Poisson-distributed) number of clusters that, on average, would themselves contain gamma-distributed number of individuals presumably determined by stochastic birth, death and immigration processes. Scale invariant exponential dispersion models also serve as limiting distributions for a wide range of other general linearized models, a property which could explain the manifestation of the variance to mean power function in so many diverse and complex natural processes and simulations.},

However, goals of mitigation measures are often unclear, and the effects on biodiversity of mitigation measures is rarely monitored. We assessed the effects of different revegetation treatments (natural revegetation, seeding, planting) on vegetation development along highways, and on wildlife crossings of different age. Location Highways in southeast Norway. Methods We collected data on vascular plant species, vegetation cover and height, soil grain size and organic matter content, and compared the species composition, richness, and diversity of the restored sites with reference plots in the adjacent target vegetation (mature forest). Results Our results show a significantly higher richness and diversity in restored plots compared to reference plots, and an increased similarity of species composition over time. Species composition was most similar to reference plots in naturally revegetated plots and seeding seemed to reduce both species and functional trait composition similarity. Conclusions It is unrealistic that the defined target vegetation will develop on restored sites. Defining a realistic and achievable target vegetation for each road construction project in relation to land use, adjacent vegetation type and successional stage, as e.g., forest edge instead of forest, would be useful. While this may require more effort for management it will translate to higher mitigation success.},

Using a case study of 65 tundra plant species abundances and 3 key functional traits measured across 325 sites, we show how the JSTDM approach (1) estimates the statistical associations among species abundances, species-level traits, and site-level traits, relative to environmental variation; (2) improves predictions on trait variation by using information on species abundances; and (3) generates hypotheses about trait-driven community assembly mechanisms. The JSTDM methodology presented in this study allows assessing the interplay between species abundances and traits at the community level, providing the much needed modeling tools to quantify the role of phenotypic trait variation in eco-evolutionary community assembly.},

@article{laughlinIntrinsicDimensionalityPlant2014,
    abstract = {Plants are multifaceted organisms that have evolved numerous solutions to the problem of establishing, growing and reproducing with limited resources. The intrinsic dimensionality of plant traits is the minimum number of independent axes of variation that adequately describes the functional variation among plants and is therefore a fundamental quantity in comparative plant ecology. Given the large number of functional traits that are measured on plants, the dimensionality of plant form and function is potentially vast. A variety of linear and nonlinear methods were used to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of three large trait data sets. The results of these analyses indicate that while the dimensionality of plant traits is generally larger than we have admitted in the past, it does not exceed six in the most comprehensive data set. The dimensionality of plant form and function is a blessing, not a curse. The higher the intrinsic dimension of traits in an analysis, the more easily our models will be able to accurately discriminate species in trait space and therefore be able to predict species distributions and abundances. Recent analyses indicate that the ability to predict community composition increases rapidly with additional traits, but reaches a plateau after four to eight traits. Synthesis. There appears to be a tractable upper limit to the dimensionality of plant traits. To optimize research efficiency for advancing our understanding of trait-based community assembly, ecologists should minimize the number of traits while maximizing the number of dimensions, because including multiple correlated traits does not yield dividends and including more than eight traits leads to diminishing returns. It is recommended to measure traits from multiple organs whenever possible, especially leaf, stem, root and flowering traits, given their consistent performance in explaining community assembly across different ecosystems.},

    abstract = {Mixed-effects models are among the most commonly used statistical methods for the exploration of multispecies data. In recent years, also Joint Species Distribution Models and Generalized Linear Latent Variale Models have gained in popularity when the goal is to incorporate residual covariation between species that cannot be explained due to measured environmental covariates. Few software implementations of such models exist that can additionally incorporate phylogenetic information, and those that exist tend to utilize Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for estimation, so that model fitting takes a long time. In this article we develop new methods for quickly and flexibly fitting phylogenetic mixed-effects models, potentially incorporating residual covariation between species using latent variables, with the possibility to estimate the strength of phylogenetic structuring in species responses per environmental covariate, and while incorporating correlation between different covariate effects. By combining Variational approximations, a sparse approximation to the phylogenetic precision matrix, and parallel computation, phylogenetic mixed-effects models can be fitted much more quickly than the current state-of-the-art. Two simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed combination of approximations is fast and enjoys high accuracy. We explore sensitivity of the approximation to the ordering of species with a real world dataset of wood-decaying fungi.},

The previously proposed sparse interactions model overcomes this challenge by assuming that most species pairs do not interact. We propose an alternative model that does not assume that any of the interactions are necessarily zero, but summarizes the influences of individual species by a small number of community-level drivers. The community-level drivers are defined as linear combinations of species abundances, and they may thus represent e.g. the total abundance of all species or the relative proportions of different functional groups. We show with simulated and real data how our approach can be used to compare different hypotheses on community structure. In an empirical example using aquatic microorganisms, the community-level drivers model clearly outperformed the sparse interactions model in predicting independent validation data.},

@article{thorsonSpatialFactorAnalysis2015,
    abstract = {Predicting and explaining the distribution and density of species is one of the oldest concerns in ecology. Species distributions can be estimated using geostatistical methods, which estimate a latent spatial variable explaining observed variation in densities, but geostatistical methods may be imprecise for species with low densities or few observations. Additionally, simple geostatistical methods fail to account for correlations in distribution among species and generally estimate such cross-correlations as a post hoc exercise. We therefore present spatial factor analysis (SFA), a spatial model for estimating a low-rank approximation to multivariate data, and use it to jointly estimate the distribution of multiple species simultaneously. We also derive an analytic estimate of cross-correlations among species from SFA parameters. As a first example, we show that distributions for 10 bird species in the breeding bird survey in 2012 can be parsimoniously represented using only five spatial factors. As a second case study, we show that forward prediction of catches for 20 rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) off the U.S. West Coast is more accurate using SFA than analysing each species individually. Finally, we show that single-species models give a different picture of cross-correlations than joint estimation using SFA. Spatial factor analysis complements a growing list of tools for jointly modelling the distribution of multiple species and provides a parsimonious summary of cross-correlation without requiring explicit declaration of habitat variables. We conclude by proposing future research that would model species cross-correlations using dissimilarity of species' traits, and the development of spatial dynamic factor analysis for a low-rank approximation to spatial time-series data.},

    abstract = {We present a hierarchical latent variable model that partitions variation in species occurrences and co-occurrences simultaneously at multiple spatial scales. We illustrate how the parameterized model can be used to predict the occurrences of a species by using as predictors not only the environmental covariates, but also the occurrences of all other species, at all spatial scales. We leverage recent progress in Bayesian latent variable models to implement a computationally effective algorithm that enables one to consider large communities and extensive sampling schemes. We exemplify the framework with a community of 98 fungal species sampled in c. 22 500 dead wood units in 230 plots in 29 beech forests. The networks identified by correlations and partial correlations were consistent, as were networks for natural and managed forests, but networks at different spatial scales were dissimilar. Accounting for the occurrences of the other species roughly doubled the predictive powers of the models compared to accounting for environmental covariates only .},

@article{vanderveenPredictingNicheOverlap2024,
    abstract = {The ecological niche is a fundamental concept in ecology that can be used in order better understand species relationships. The overlap in species niches provides a measure of the likelihood for species to co-occur. Most approaches that quantify niche overlap have been based on distance and similarity indices, for pairwise combinations of species. In this paper, we suggest that niche overlap can be calculated from the predictions of a model. Using a statistical model to predict niche overlap provides various benefits, includes the possibility to adjust the model to properties of the data. We demonstrate this using an example dataset of an ecological community of Foraminifera species, to which we fit a generalized linear latent variable model (GLLVM). GLLVMs are a flexible class of models that allow to estimate the distribution of species using both measured environmental predictors and residual covariation between species. We demonstrate how to calculate niche overlap from GLLVMs for any combination of species, and separately for different environments. Predicting niche overlap from a model further expands the toolset available to ecologists for the exploration of species co-occurrence patterns.},

@article{vanderveenModelbasedOrdinationSpecies2021,
    abstract = {It is common practice for ecologists to examine species niches in the study of community composition. The response curve of a species in the fundamental niche is usually assumed to be quadratic. The centre of a quadratic curve represents a species' optimal environmental conditions, and the width its ability to tolerate deviations from the optimum. Most multivariate methods assume species respond linearly to niche axes, or with a quadratic curve that is of equal width for all species. However, it is widely understood that some species have the ability to better tolerate deviations from their optimal environment (generalists) compared to other (specialist) species. Rare species often tolerate a smaller range of environments than more common species, corresponding to a narrow niche. We propose a new method, for ordination and fitting Joint Species Distribution Models, based on Generalized Linear Mixed-effects Models, which relaxes the assumptions of equal tolerances. By explicitly estimating species maxima, and species optima and tolerances per ecological gradient, we can better explore how species relate to each other.},

@article{maslenHowManySites2023,
    abstract = {Sample size estimation through power analysis is a fundamental tool in planning an ecological study, yet there are currently no well-established procedures for when multivariate abundances are to be collected. A power analysis procedure would need to address three challenges: designing a parsimonious simulation model that captures key community data properties; measuring effect size in a realistic yet interpretable fashion; and ensuring computational feasibility when simulation is used both for power estimation and significance testing. Here, we propose a power analysis procedure that addresses these three challenges by: using for simulation a Gaussian copula model with factor analytical structure, fitted to pilot data; assuming a common effect size across all taxa, but applied in different directions according to expert opinion (to ``increaser'', ``decreaser'' or ``no effect'' taxa); using a critical value approach to estimate power, which reduces computation time by a factor of 500 (if we would otherwise use 999 resamples to estimate each p-value) with minor loss of accuracy. The procedure is demonstrated on pilot data from fish assemblages in a restoration study, where it was found that the planned study design would only be capable of detecting relatively large effects (change in abundance by a factor of 1.7 or more). The methods outlined in this paper are available in accompanying R software (the ecopower package), which allows researchers with pilot data to answer a wide range of design questions to assist them in planning their studies.},
