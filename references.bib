  abstract = {We use the occurrence of unusual or out-of-season dust storms and dissolved ion data as proxies for dust to propose a calendar-year chronology for a portion of the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) ice core during the early sixth century A.D. Our new time scale moves a small sulfate peak to early 537 A.D., which is more consistent with recent findings of a 6 mo to 18 mo time lag between volcanic eruptions and atmospheric fallout of their sulfate aerosols. Our new time scale is consistent with a small volcanic input to the A.D. 536--537 climate downturn. We use the time range of Ni-rich fragments and cosmic spherules to provide an independent test of the chronology. The time range of Ni-rich fragments and cosmic spherules matches historical observations of ``dancing stars'' starting in the summer of A.D. 533 and lasting until A.D. 539 or 540. These dancing stars have been previously attributed to cosmogenic dust loading of Earth's atmosphere. The time scale cannot be shifted to be either younger or older by 1 yr without destroying the match to historical accounts of dancing stars.},

Using a previously derived calendar-year time scale, these particles span a time of increased dust loading of Earth's atmosphere between A.D. 533 and 540. The Sn-rich and Ni-rich particles contain an average of 10--11 wt\% C. Their high C contents coupled with local enrichments in the volatile elements I, Zn, Cu, and Xe suggest a cometary source for the dust. The late spring timing of extraterrestrial input best matches the Eta Aquarid meteor shower associated with comet 1P/Halley. An increased flux of cometary dust might explain a modest climate downturn in A.D. 533. Both cometary dust and volcanic sulfate probably contributed to the profound global dimming during A.D. 536 and 537 but may be insufficient sources of fine aerosols. We found tropical marine microfossils and aerosol-sized CaCO3 particles at the end A.D. 535--start A.D. 536 level that we attribute to a low-latitude explosion in the ocean. This additional source of dust is probably needed to explain the solar dimming during A.D. 536 and 537. Although there has been no extinction documented at A.D. 536, our results are relevant because mass extinctions may also have multiple drivers. Detailed examinations of fine particles at and near extinction horizons can help to determine the relative contributions of cosmic and volcanic drivers to mass extinctions.},

  abstract = {To advance predictive ecology, the hypothesis of hierarchical predictability proposes that community measures for which species are interchangeable (e.g., structure and species richness) are more predictable than measures for which species identity matters (e.g., community composition). Predictability is hypothesized to decrease for response measures in order of the following categories: structure, species richness, function, and species composition. We tested this hypothesis using a 14-year, oak savanna--prairie restoration experiment that removed non-native pine plantations at 24 sites in northwestern Ohio, USA. Based on 24 response measures, the data showed minimal support for the hypothesis, because response measures varied in predictability within categories. Half of response measures had over half their variability modeled using fixed (restoration treatment and year) and random plot effects, and these ``predictable'' measures occurred in all four categories. Pine basal area, environment (e.g., soil texture), and antecedent vegetation accounted for over half the variation in change within the first three post-restoration years for 77\% of response measures. Change between the 3rd and 14th years was less predictable, but most restoration measures increased favorably via sites achieving them in unique ways. We propose that variation will not conform with the hypothesis of hierarchical predictability in ecosystems with vegetation dynamics driven by stochastic processes such as seed dispersal, or where vegetation structure and species richness are influenced by species composition. The ability to predict a community measure may be more driven by the number of combinations of casual factors affecting a measure than by the number of values it can have.},

In such cases, the correlation between the training and test sets could have a notable impact on the model's prediction error. To overcome this issue, an automatic group construction procedure for leave-group-out cross validation (LGOCV) has recently emerged as a valuable tool for enhancing predictive performance measurement in structured models. The purpose of this paper is (i) to compare LOOCV and LGOCV within structured models, emphasizing model selection and predictive performance, and (ii) to provide real data applications in spatial statistics using complex structured models fitted with INLA, showcasing the utility of the automatic LGOCV method. First, we briefly review the key aspects of the recently proposed LGOCV method for automatic group construction in latent Gaussian models. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of this method for selecting the model with the highest predictive performance by simulating extrapolation tasks in both temporal and spatial data analyses. Finally, we provide insights into the effectiveness of the LGOCV method in modelling complex structured data, encompassing spatio-temporal multivariate count data, spatial compositional data, and spatio-temporal geospatial data.},

The ice-core record presented visible layering of annual accumulation and of {$\delta$} 18O/{$\delta$}D stable isotopes, and a clear tritium reference horizon. A steady-state glacier flow model for layer thinning was calibrated and applied to establish a depth/age scale. Four radiocarbon (14C) measurements of particulate organic carbon contained in ice-core samples revealed dates for the bottom part of Bl2003 from 9075 {\textpm} 1221 cal a BC at 145.2 {\textpm} 0.1 m w.e. (0.665 m w.e. from the bedrock) to 790 {\textpm} 93 AD at 121.1 m w.e. depth. Sulfate peaks coincident with volcanic eruptions, the Tunguska meteorite event, and the 1842 dust storm were used to verify dating. Analysis of the Bl2003 ice core reveals that the modern Altai glaciers were formed during the Younger Dryas (YD) ({\textasciitilde}10 950 to {\textasciitilde}7500 cal a BC), and that they survived the Holocene Climate Optimum (HCO) ({\textasciitilde}6500 to {\textasciitilde}3600 cal a BC) and the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) ({\textasciitilde}640 to {\textasciitilde}1100 AD). A decrease in air temperature at the beginning and an abrupt increase at the end of the YD were identified. Intensification of winds and dust loading related to Asian desert expansion also characterized the YD. During the YD major ion concentrations increased significantly, up to 50 times for Na+ (background), up to 45 times for Ca2+ and Mg2+, and up to 20 times for SO4 2- relative to the recent warm period from 1993 to 2003. A warm period lasted for about three centuries following the YD signaling onset of the HCO. A significant and prolonged decrease in air temperature from {\textasciitilde}2000 to {\textasciitilde}600 cal a BC was associated with a severe centennial drought (SCD). A sharp increase in air temperatures after the SCD was coincident with the MWP. After the MWP a cooling was followed gradually with further onset of the Little Ice Age. During the modern warm period (1973--2003) an increase in air temperature is noted, which nearly reaches the average of HCO and MWP air temperature values.},

Secundo episodes were characterized by warmer high-latitude climates, salinity-dense oceanic bottom waters, low diversity planktonic communities, and carbonate formation in shallow waters. Extinction events occurred between primo and secundo episodes, with stepwise extinctions of taxa reflecting fluctuating conditions during the transition period. The pattern of turnover shown by conodont faunas, together with sedimentological information and data from other fossil groups, permit the identification of two cycles in the Llandovery to earliest Wenlock interval.

Determined by landscape structure as well as dispersal-related traits of species, connectivity influences various key aspects of population biology, ranging from population persistence to genetic structure and diversity. Here, we investigated differences in small-scale connectivity in terms of gene flow between populations of two ecologically important invertebrates with contrasting dispersal-related traits: an amphipod (Gammarus fossarum) with a purely aquatic life cycle and a mayfly (Baetis rhodani) with a terrestrial adult stage. 2. We used highly polymorphic markers to estimate genetic differentiation between populations of both species within a Swiss pre-alpine catchment and compared these results to the broader-scale genetic structure within the Rhine drainage. Landscape genetic approaches were used to test for correlations of genetic and geographical structures and in-stream barrier effects. 3. We found overall very weak genetic structure in populations of B. rhodani. In contrast, G. fossarum showed strong genetic differentiation, even at spatial scales of a few kilometres, and a clear pattern of isolation by distance. Genetic diversity decreased from downstream towards upstream populations of G. fossarum, suggesting asymmetric gene flow. Correlation of genetic structure with landscape topography was more pronounced in the amphipod. Our study also indicates that G. fossarum might be capable of dispersing overland in headwater regions and of crossing small in-stream barriers. 4. We speculate that differences in dispersal capacity but also habitat specialisation and potentially the extent of local adaptation could be responsible for the differences in genetic differentiation found between the two species. These results highlight the importance of taking into account dispersal-related traits when planning management and conservation strategies.},

Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

Although counterintuitive at first sight, the quantum world has potential to inform macro-systems of people and nature. Using time series and spatial analysis of bird, phytoplankton and benthic invertebrate communities, this paper shows that superposition can occur analogously in redundancy analysis (RDA) frequently used by ecologists. RESULTS: We show that within individual ecosystems single species can be associated simultaneously with different orthogonal axes in RDA models, which suggests that they operate in more than one niche spaces. We discuss this counterintuitive result in relation to the statistical and mathematical features of RDA and the recognized limitations with current traditional species concepts based on vegetative morphology. CONCLUSION: We suggest that such "quantum weirdness" in the models is reconcilable with classical ecosystems logic when the focus of research shifts from morphological species to cryptic species that consist of genetically and ecologically differentiated subpopulations. We support our argument with theoretical discussions of eco-evolutionary interpretations that should become testable once suitable data are available.},

We propose a set of best-practice standards and detailed guidelines enabling scoring of studies based on species distribution models for use in biodiversity assessments. We reviewed and scored 400 modeling studies over the past 20 years using the proposed standards and guidelines. We detected low model adequacy overall, but with a marked tendency of improvement over time in model building and, to a lesser degree, in biological data and model evaluation. We argue that implementation of agreed-upon standards for models in biodiversity assessments would promote transparency and repeatability, eventually leading to higher quality of the models and the inferences used in assessments. We encourage broad community participation toward the expansion and ongoing development of the proposed standards and guidelines.},

  abstract = {Metal wastes have been repeatedly shown to significantly disturb periphytic communities. This study considers an industrial contamination site subjected to remediation processes since 2007. With the aim of finding relevant bioindicators of the restoration capacity of such impacted hydrosystems, this study focussed on biofilm and diatom recovery kinetics. Biofilms were colonised at a reference site and in parallel at a metal-contaminated site. After 24 days, contaminated biofilms were translocated to the reference site to study the biofilm recovery potential for 9 weeks under natural conditions. Analyses from the community level - measures of metal bioaccumulation. cell densities and taxonomic investigations - to the individual level - measures of teratological forms - were performed. The results showed that Zn and Cd contents were rapidly depurated, reaching reference levels 3 and 9 weeks after translocadon, respectively. A Principal Response Curve (PRC) analysis enabled to see the fast evolution of diatom communities, with species specific to the reference site growing in decontaminated biofilms from the 3rd week. After 9 weeks, we estimated that diatom community restructuring was complete, based on measurements of biovolumes and teratological form rates which both decreased to reference levels in decontaminated biofilms throughout the experiment. The different teratological types appeared to be good bioindicators of biofilm contamination and shed light on the duration of contamination. According to these results, different criteria can provide information on the recovery potential of periphyton. Biofilms proved to be good bioindicators of metal recovery and diatoms proved to be good bioindicators of community recovery. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

One dramatic change at Helg{\"o} was the apparent abandonment around 530 of the Migration Period casting of bronze artefacts in Building group 3. A vast accumulation of casting moulds and crucibles was found here. The magnitude makes this context unique in northern Europe. Usually, the very fine-grained quarts sand used for the mould and crucibles was reused, and thus it would not accumulate. Another incident is that the open-air offering place, known to be in use already from the Later Roman Iron Age is abandoned. From this point, the cultic events are performed indoors in a large hall. Further, from this period onwards, the cemeteries on the site are commenced, indicating that the site now becomes permanently inhabited. Finally, although previously not known as a grave gift, bread is regularly found in graves.},

The impact of environmental factors on fish species and communities was analyzed with regression and ordination methods. Fish assemblages, probability of occurrences, and abundance of many fish species were very different between our results at the eastern edge of Europe and those reported from further west in the continent. The size (area) of lakes was the main environmental variable (positively) influencing total abundance, the total number of fish species, and the Shannon diversity index. The probability of occurrence of more than half of the fish species was related to the area and bottom substrate, either on its own or in combination with elevation and water depth. For the first time at this eastern edge of Europe, means and standard deviations for fish species along basic environmental gradients were estimated. The latter were highly variable between species.},

  abstract = {The globally increasing pace of ecosystem degradation makes it necessary to develop efficient restoration programmes. A reliable tool for estimation of the remaining time to recovery is an important component of such a programme. In this study, we explore the performance of the novel, ordination regression-based approach (ORBA) for prediction of time to recovery. We applied ORBA to a dataset of plant species composition data from ten spoil heap sites in S Norway, resulting from hydropower development. Five study sites were situated in the alpine and five in the boreal bioclimatic zone, the latter group showing large between-site variability of climate, time since disturbance (age) and restoration treatments. The vegetation of spoil heaps was recorded at two time-points, while that of the surroundings of each spoil heap was recorded once, to serve as a reference. We obtained time-to-recovery predictions based on ordination of the full dataset and of two data subsets that represented alpine and boreal sites, respectively. The vegetation of all spoil heaps became more similar to the vegetation of their surroundings over time. In many cases, linear models described the temporal pattern less well than asymptotic models. The latter models predicted slow recovery for all sites, but showed large variation in time to recovery among the boreal sites. In some of the boreal sites, we observed extremely species-poor plots and many infrequent species. Moreover, in one site we observed apparent mismatch between observed vegetation development and the underlying model of increasing similarity to surroundings. We ascribed these cases to suboptimal restoration practises, and for them, non-significant ORBA models resulted. Our findings support the conclusions of previous studies; that ORBA is a robust method for predicting time to recovery over a wide range of restoration projects. Its output -- predicted time (years) to recovery -- is easily communicated and may be useful in evaluating the speed and direction of restoration programmes. However, our results also demonstrate the importance of carefully assessing the properties of datasets (e.g. plotwise species richness) subjected to ORBA analyses.},

  abstract = {Given the importance of knowledge of species distribution for conservation and climate change management, continuous and progressive evaluation of the statistical models predicting species distributions is necessary. Current models are evaluated in terms of ecological theory used, the data model accepted and the statistical methods applied. Focus is restricted to Generalised Linear Models (GLM) and Generalised Additive Models (GAM). Certain currently unused regression methods are reviewed for their possible application to species modelling. A review of recent papers suggests that ecological theory is rarely explicitly considered. Current theory and results support species responses to environmental variables to be unimodal and often skewed though process-based theory is often lacking. Many studies fail to test for unimodal or skewed responses and straight-line relationships are often fitted without justification. Data resolution (size of sampling unit) determines the nature of the environmental niche models that can be fitted. A synthesis of differing ecophysiological ideas and the use of biophysical processes models could improve the selection of predictor variables. A better conceptual framework is needed for selecting variables. Comparison of statistical methods is difficult. Predictive success is insufficient and a test of ecological realism is also needed. Evaluation of methods needs artificial data, as there is no knowledge about the true relationships between variables for field data. However, use of artificial data is limited by lack of comprehensive theory. Three potentially new methods are reviewed. Quantile regression (QR) has potential and a strong theoretical justification in Liebig's law of the minimum. Structural equation modelling (SEM) has an appealing conceptual framework for testing causality but has problems with curvilinear relationships. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) intended to examine spatial non-stationarity of ecological processes requires further evaluation before being used. Synthesis and applications: explicit theory needs to be incorporated into species response models used in conservation. For example, testing for unimodal skewed responses should be a routine procedure. Clear statements of the ecological theory used, the nature of the data model and sufficient details of the statistical method are needed for current models to be evaluated. New statistical methods need to be evaluated for compatibility with ecological theory before use in applied ecology. Some recent work with artificial data suggests the combination of ecological knowledge and statistical skill is more important than the precise statistical method used. The potential exists for a synthesis of current species modelling approaches based on their differing ecological insights not their methodology.},

  abstract = {The Pacific Arctic marine ecosystem has undergone rapid changes in recent years due to ocean warming, sea ice loss, and increased northward transport of Pacific-origin waters into the Arctic. These climate-mediated changes have been linked to range shifts of juvenile and adult subarctic (boreal) and Arctic fish populations, though it is unclear whether distributional changes are also occurring during the early life stages. We analyzed larval fish abundance and distribution data sampled in late summer from 2010 to 2019 in two interconnected Pacific Arctic ecosystems: the northern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea, to determine whether recent warming and loss of sea ice has restricted habitat for Arctic species and altered larval fish assemblage composition from Arctic- to boreal-associated taxa. Multivariate analyses revealed the presence of three distinct multi-species assemblages across all years: (1) a boreal assemblage dominated by yellowfin sole (Limanda aspera), capelin (Mallotus catervarius), and walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus); (2) an Arctic assemblage composed of Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) and other common Arctic species; and (3) a mixed assemblage composed of the dominant species from the other two assemblages. We found that the wind- and current-driven northward advection of warmer, subarctic waters and the unprecedented low-ice conditions observed in the northern Bering and Chukchi seas beginning in 2017 and persisting into 2018 and 2019 have precipitated community-wide shifts, with the boreal larval fish assemblage expanding northward and offshore and the Arctic assemblage retreating poleward. We conclude that Arctic warming is most significantly driving changes in abundance at the leading and trailing edges of the Chukchi Sea larval fish community as boreal species increase in abundance and Arctic species decline. Our analyses document how quickly larval fish assemblages respond to environmental change and reveal that the impacts of Arctic borealization on fish community composition spans multiple life stages over large spatial scales.},

Twenty species of mayflies and 78 species of caddisflies were recorded. Clearly lotic mayflies in the material were Baetis subalpinus, Heptagenia sulphurea and Ephemerella mucronata, which occurred only in the stream samples. Females of lotic Baetis rhodani had a long distance upstream flight in the area and occurred frequently in the floating emergence traps especially in sandy littoral habitats of L. Konnevesi. Procloeon bifidum and Nixe joernensis, which in some regions occur mainly in streams, were frequently found in the stony littoral belt of L. Konnevesi. Most of the mayflies recorded in the area were univoltine, but Baetis rhodani and Centroptilum luteolum at least had two generations in 1983. Strictly lotic species among caddisflies were Ceratopsyche nevae, Hydropsyche saxonica, Halesus digitatus, Ceraclea perplexa, Ylodes detruncatus, Athripsodes commutatus and Hydroptila forcipata. These were mainly found in stream samples. A short distance upstream flight of females (c. 0.1-0.4 km) was observed in the populations of H. siltalai, Psychomyia pusilla and Oxyethira frici and a moderate distance flight (at least 0.6 km) by females of Hydropsyche pellucidula, Cheumatopsyche lepida and Polycentropus irroratus. The most abundant caddisflies of the stream Siikakoski (Brachycentrus subnubilus, Neureclipsis bimaculata, Rhyacophila nubila, Agapetus ochripes, Micrasema setiferum and Hydroptila cornuta) were frequently found also in floating emergence traps in the lake (3. 7 km from the rapids). Females of Brachycentrus, Neureclipsis and Rhyacophila favoured traps on sandy substrata while females of Hydroptila were usually found in the stony belt. In the trap material of Agapetus ochripes, males were more abundant than females. According to emergence data, all caddisflies recorded in the area were univoltine though the emerging period of several species such as Rhyacophila nubila and Neureclipsis bimaculata was long. Maximum emergence was observed in early June when brachycentrids were swarming and another peak in August when limnephilids and leptocerids were abundant.},

Although this climatic downturn was proposed as a major cause for pandemic and extensive societal upheavals in the sixth-seventh centuries CE, archaeological evidence for the magnitude of societal response to this event is sparse. This study uses ancient trash mounds as a type of proxy for identifying societal crisis in the urban domain, and employs multidisciplinary investigations to establish the terminal date of organized trash collection and high-level municipal functioning on a city-wide scale. Survey, excavation, sediment analysis, and geographic information system assessment of mound volume were conducted on a series of mounds surrounding the Byzantine urban settlement of Elusa in the Negev Desert. These reveal the massive collection and dumping of domestic and construction waste over time on the city edges. Carbon dating of charred seeds and charcoal fragments combined with ceramic analysis establish the end date of orchestrated trash removal near the mid-sixth century, coinciding closely with the beginning of the LALIA event and outbreak of the Justinian Plague in the year 541. This evidence for societal decline during the sixth century ties with other arguments for urban dysfunction across the Byzantine Levant at this time. We demonstrate the utility of trash mounds as sensitive proxies of social response and unravel the time-space dynamics of urban collapse, suggesting diminished resilience to rapid climate change in the frontier Negev region of the empire.},

By finding correlations of EIVs with morphological or ecophysiological properties, it is possible to identify determinants of species distributions with respect to environmental factors. We surveyed existing literature containing species comparisons from controlled experiments and combined them with EIVs. The picture emerging is that multiple determinants can be identified for nutrient numbers (N), soil reaction numbers (R) and also soil moisture numbers (M), while only few can be found for light numbers (L) and especially for continentality (C) and temperature numbers (T). Functional characterizations of the different EIV can thus be deduced which help to understand the mechanisms and processes driving the ecological niche of a plant. The described approach is a powerful tool to analyse the ecological significance of different plant properties. Species screenings specifically designed to allow for correlations with EIV have large potential for high explanatory power.},

The OA movement is an anti-corporatist movement that wants to deny the freedom of the press to companies it disagrees with. The movement is also actively imposing onerous mandates on researchers, mandates that restrict individual freedom. To boost the open-access movement, its leaders sacrifice the academic futures of young scholars and those from developing countries, pressuring them to publish in lower-quality open-access journals. The open-access movement has fostered the creation of numerous predatory publishers and standalone journals, increasing the amount of research misconduct in scholarly publications and the amount of pseudo-science that is published as if it were authentic science.},

What Bergmann and Sams found was that their students demonstrated a deeper understanding of the material than ever before. This is the authors' story, and they're confident it can be yours too. Learn what a flipped classroom is and why it works, and get the information you need to flip a classroom. You'll also learn the flipped mastery model, where students learn at their own pace, furthering opportunities for personalized education. This simple concept is easily replicable in any classroom, doesn't cost much to implement, and helps foster self-directed learning. Once you flip, you won't want to go back},

  abstract = {Ecological restoration is critical for recovering degraded ecosystems but is challenged by variable success and low predictability. Understanding which outcomes are more predictable and less variable following restoration can improve restoration effectiveness. Recent theory asserts that the predictability of outcomes would follow an order from most to least predictable from coarse to fine community properties (physical structure {$>$} taxonomic diversity {$>$} functional composition {$>$} taxonomic composition) and that predictability would increase with more severe environmental conditions constraining species establishment. We tested this ``hierarchy of predictability'' hypothesis by synthesizing outcomes along an aridity gradient with 11 grassland restoration projects across the United States. We used 1829 vegetation monitoring plots from 227 restoration treatments, spread across 52 sites. We fit generalized linear mixed-effects models to predict six indicators of restoration outcomes as a function of restoration characteristics (i.e., seed mixes, disturbance, management actions, time since restoration) and used variance explained by models and model residuals as proxies for restoration predictability. We did not find consistent support for our hypotheses. Physical structure was among the most predictable outcomes when the response variable was relative abundance of grasses, but unpredictable for total canopy cover. Similarly, one dimension of taxonomic composition related to species identities was unpredictable, but another dimension of taxonomic composition indicating whether exotic or native species dominated the community was highly predictable. Taxonomic diversity (i.e., species richness) and functional composition (i.e., mean trait values) were intermittently predictable. Predictability also did not increase consistently with aridity. The dimension of taxonomic composition related to the identity of species in restored communities was more predictable (i.e., smaller residuals) in more arid sites, but functional composition was less predictable (i.e., larger residuals), and other outcomes showed no significant trend. Restoration outcomes were most predictable when they related to variation in dominant species, while those responding to rare species were harder to predict, indicating a potential role of scale in restoration predictability. Overall, our results highlight additional factors that might influence restoration predictability and add support to the importance of continuous monitoring and active management beyond one-time seed addition for successful grassland restoration in the United States.},

In this review I provide a comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of any exhaustive rigor.

To better understand why plant responses vary across regions, we compared change in plant cover over time with nine functional traits of 12 dominant species in three regions of northern Alaska (Utqia{\.g}vik, Atqasuk, and Toolik Lake). Cover was measured three times from 2008 to 2018. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) found that one species --- Carex aquatilis --- showed significant change in cover over time, increasing by 12.7\% at Atqasuk. Canonical correspondence analysis suggested a relationship between shifts in species cover and traits, but Pearson and Spearman rank correlations did not find a significant trend for any trait when analyzed individually. Investigation of community-weighted means (CWMs) for each trait revealed no significant changes over time for any trait in any region. By comparison, estimated ecosystem values for several traits important to ecosystem functioning showed consistent increases over time in two regions (Utqia{\.g}vik and Atqasuk). Our results indicate that vascular plant community composition and function have remained consistent over time; however, documented increases in total plant cover have important implications for ecosystem functioning.},

Our perspective is that models are developed iteratively: We build a model, use it to analyze data, assess how it succeeds and fails, revise it, and repeat. We describe how new research has transformed these essential activities. First, we describe probabilistic graphical models, a language for formulating latent variable models. Second, we describe mean field variational inference, a generic algorithm for approximating conditional distributions. Third, we describe how to use our analyses to solve problems: exploring the data, forming predictions, and pointing us in the direction of improved models.},

Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult.

The objective of this study was to investigate the trajectory of ecosystems under restoration in two (PL2) and seven (PL7) years since the initial seedling planting with tree species after bauxite mining in Eastern Amazon, Brazil. Soil's physical and chemical parameters (organic matter, bulk density, porosity, infiltration, and fertility) and attributes of the established vegetation (abundance of individuals and families, Hill numbers - H0, H1, and H2, non-metric multidimensional scaling - nMDS and distance-based redundancy analysis - dbRDA) were assessed. Planting seven-year-old seedlings led to the establishment of vegetation with diversity metrics comparable to those of the reference forest, particularly in the upper vegetation stratum. However, this ecosystem has not improved the soil's physical quality and did not promote increase in organic matter in relation to the 2-year-old seedling planting restoration ecosystem. This was mainly due to inadequate operational procedures, such as the control of regenerating plants, terrain reconstruction with moist substrate, and the use of some non-adapted tree species in the initial seedling planting. Restoring areas need to be monitored and restoration methods and procedures reviewed in order to optimize restoration processes after bauxite mining in the Amazon.},

Overall, flipped classroom interventions produced positive gains across all three learning domains, and we found significant advantages of flipped over lecture-based instruction for seven out of eight outcomes (gs = 0.20--0.53). At the same time, there was substantial heterogeneity in flipped learning effects, and we identified several variables that influenced the relative efficacy of flipped versus traditional courses.

To harness ecological restoration's full potential, significant advances to predictive capacity must be made in restoration ecology. We outline a process for predicting restoration outcomes, based on the model of iterative forecasting. We then describe six challenges that impede predictive capabilities in restoration and, for each, an agenda for overcoming the challenge. Key challenges include the lack of clear goals, insufficient knowledge of why restoration outcomes vary, difficulty quantifying known drivers of variation prior to initiation of restoration projects, model uncertainty, the need to scale up local understanding to guide large-scale restoration efforts, and temporally variable conditions that hinder long-term forecast accuracy. Meeting these challenges will require research to resolve key drivers of variation in restoration outcomes; however, there is also a critical need to begin forecasting efforts in restoration ecology immediately. Although early efforts may be of limited practical utility, iterating between model development and evaluation will resolve data needs, minimize uncertainty, and lead to predictions that practitioners can confidently embrace. In turn, a robust predictive capacity will help to reliably meet goals, enhance cost-effectiveness, and guide policy decisions to help see out the promise of the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.},

Methodology We reviewed the ecological literature from 1990 to 2018 that used multivariate methods to address questions of temporal community dynamics. For each paper that fulfilled our search criteria, we recorded the types of multivariate analysis used to characterise temporal community dynamics in addition to the research aim, habitat type, location, taxon and the experimental design. Results Most studies had relatively few temporal replicates; the median number was seven time points. Nearly 70\% of studies applied more than one analysis method; descriptive methods such as bar graphs and ordination were the most commonly applied methods. Surprisingly, the types of analyses used were only related to the number of temporal replicates, but not to research aim or any other aspects of experimental design such as taxon, or habitat or year of study. Conclusions This review reveals that most studies interested in understanding community dynamics use relatively short time series meaning that several, more sophisticated, temporal analyses are not widely applicable. However, newer methods using multivariate dissimilarities are growing in popularity and many can be applied to time series of any length.},

In particular, the sixth century coincides with rising and falling civilizations, pandemics, human migration and political turmoil. Our understanding of the magnitude and spatial extent as well as the possible causes and concurrences of climate change during this period is, however, still limited. Here we use tree-ring chronologies from the Russian Altai and European Alps to reconstruct summer temperatures over the past two millennia. We find an unprecedented, long-lasting and spatially synchronized cooling following a cluster of large volcanic eruptions in 536, 540 and 547 AD (ref. 14), which was probably sustained by ocean and sea-ice feedbacks, as well as a solar minimum. We thus identify the interval from 536 to about 660 AD as the Late Antique Little Ice Age. Spanning most of the Northern Hemisphere, we suggest that this cold phase be considered as an additional environmental factor contributing to the establishment of the Justinian plague, transformation of the eastern Roman Empire and collapse of the Sasanian Empire, movements out of the Asian steppe and Arabian Peninsula, spread of Slavic-speaking peoples and political upheavals in China.},

  abstract = {Context The flipped classroom (FC), reversing lecture and homework elements of a course, is popular in medical education. The FC uses technology-enhanced pre-class learning to transmit knowledge, incorporating in-class interaction to enhance higher cognitive learning. However, the FC model is expensive and research on its effectiveness remains inconclusive. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of the FC model over traditional lecture-based (LB) learning by meta-analysis. Methods We systematically searched MEDLINE, PubMed, ERIC, CINAHL, EMBASE, reference lists and Association for Medical Education in Europe (AMEE) conference books. Controlled trials comparing academic outcomes between the FC and LB approaches in higher education were considered eligible. The main findings were pooled using a random-effects model when appropriate. Results Forty-six studies (9026 participants) were included, comprising four randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 19 quasi-experimental studies and 23 cohort studies. Study populations were health science (n = 32) and non health science (n = 14) students. The risk of bias was high (36/37 articles). Meta-analyses revealed that the FC had significantly better outcomes than the LB method in examination scores (post-intervention and pre--post change) and course grades, but not in objective structured clinical examination scores. Subgroup analyses showed the advantage of the FC was not observed in RCTs, non-USA countries, nursing and other health science disciplines and earlier publication years (2013 and 2014). Cumulative analysis and meta-regression suggested a tendency for progressively better outcomes by year. Outcome assessments rarely focused on behaviour change. Conclusions The FC method is associated with greater academic achievement than the LB approach for higher-level learning outcomes, which has become more obvious in recent years. However, results should be interpreted with caution because of the high methodological diversity, statistical heterogeneity and risk of bias in the studies used. Future studies should have high methodological rigour, a standardised FC format and utilise assessment tools evaluating higher cognitive learning and behaviour change to further examine differences between FC and LB learning.},

  abstract = {Elevation-for-latitude substitution offers a tool for studying the influence of temperature and precipitation variability on vegetation structure and composition. Understanding how elevation, aspect, and slope influence vegetation patterns may help in predicting how climate change influences human forest usage and in developing strategies for ensuring the sustained provision of ecosystem services. However, most ecological studies have been carried out in protected areas, leaving forest areas used by humans to lesser attention. Therefore, we asked how elevation, aspect, and slope impact the vegetation on a human-influenced mountain. We measured woody vegetation size, richness, and composition on a mountain with plots set systematically in four cardinal directions at 100-m elevational intervals from the peak, from 1900 m to 4200 m above sea level, in the Hengduan Mountains in eastern Himalaya, southwestern China. We quantified how tree maximum height, basal area, aboveground biomass (AGB), tree and shrub species richness, and woody species composition changed with elevation, aspect, and slope. Based on generalized linear models, the maximum tree height, tree basal area, and woody species AGB followed a unimodal trend along elevational gradients, with tree height and basal area peaking at 3100 m, while AGB was highest at 3300 m and somewhat higher on the southern slope. Basal area increased with slope degree. Neither tree nor shrub species richness was influenced by elevation, aspect, or slope. According to canonical correspondence analysis and TWINSPAN classification, elevation and north-south orientation of the slope were major factors influencing woody species compositions, and vegetation was classified into five types of communities. Our results indicated that the influences of elevation, aspect, and slope on woody vegetation structure were similar in a human-influenced forested mountain area as in protected mountain landscapes based on the literature. However, as forests in this area are used more intensively at low and middle elevations of the southern and western slopes, where aridity restricts tree size and AGB, climate change is likely to challenge traditional harvesting practices and place pressure on moving forest usage to higher altitudes.},

  abstract = {Pollinators play pivotal roles in maintaining agricultural and natural plant communities, yet some bee populations are declining. Loss of pollinator habitats as a result of agricultural intensification and urbanization have reduced bee abundance and diversity. Additionally, climate change has affected bee distributions and led to disruption of plant-pollinator synchrony, impacting ecosystem processes. However, how these factors concurrently influence bee assemblages is poorly understood. Therefore, we evaluated bumble bee (Bombus) assemblages in relation to the proportion of agricultural, semi-natural, and urban land cover and interannual variation in temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity in Utah agroecosystems using Bombus captured as bycatch in pest monitoring traps from 2014 to 2018. Bombus assemblage composition was highest in agricultural sites with increased agricultural land cover in the surrounding area, low temperatures, and high relative humidity during the growing season; and lowest in sites with increased urban land cover, high temperatures, and low relative humidity. Functional dispersion did not differ among these groups indicating a range of tongue lengths, body sizes, hair lengths, and hair types were present within all agricultural sites. Further, high beta-diversity, as indicated by unique Bombus assemblages among sites, suggests that all agricultural sites in this study have potential conservation value for maintaining Bombus communities. Therefore, it is important that diverse habitats for pollinators are maintained through targeted management techniques. Additionally, our collection of Bombus from mid-May to mid-September identified phenological overlap within Bombus assemblages, which helps ensure pollination services are provided even if a particular species is lost due to environmental disturbances. However, while there is overlap in functional traits and phenology, considerations should be given due to widespread pollinator declines. Overall, evaluating landscape and climate variables together may yield more realistic results and better inform effective management and land-use planning strategies to prevent ecological homogenization and to foster future resiliency of Bombus populations.},

For the first time for this region and period, we present unique data sets for tree-ring width, cell-wall thickness, {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}18O in cellulose. These were based on multiple samples from relict wood of larch obtained from two sites close to the northern limit of tree growth on the Taimyr Peninsula and in northeastern Yakutia, and at a high-elevation, location 20{$^\circ$} further South in the Altai Mts. An event in AD 536 was associated with different, but marked, changes in tree-ring parameters at the high-latitude sites compared with the high elevation site. An AD 541 event was associated with its own distinctive tree-ring responses across the three sites and multiple variables. The years after AD 532 were marked by a strong and sustained decrease in growth at the high-elevation, more southerly, site. The combination of improved ice-core chronology for the climatically effective volcanic eruptions of this part of the 6th century AD, and an array of tree-ring sites with different climates and multiple tree-ring variables permits a richer description of tree responses to this cluster of events. The pattern of tree-ring parameter responses at the three locations in AD 536, AD 541, and perhaps AD 532 is consistent with responses to climatically effective volcanic eruptions influencing tree response in those and subsequent years.},

  abstract = {In the early 1980s, a strategy for graphical representation of multivariate (multi-species) abundance data was introduced into marine ecology by, among others, Field, et al. (1982). A decade on, it is instructive to: (i) identify which elements of this often-quoted strategy have proved most useful in practical assessment of community change resulting from pollution impact; and (ii) ask to what extent evolution of techniques in the intervening years has added self-consistency and comprehensiveness to the approach. The pivotal concept has proved to be that of a biologically-relevant definition of similarity of two samples, and its utilization mainly in simple rank form, for example `sample A is more similar to sample B than it is to sample C'. Statistical assumptions about the data are thus minimized and the resulting non-parametric techniques will be of very general applicability. From such a starting point, a unified framework needs to encompass: (i) the display of community patterns through clustering and ordination of samples; (ii) identification of species principally responsible for determining sample groupings; (iii) statistical tests for differences in space and time (multivariate analogues of analysis of variance, based on rank similarities); and (iv) the linking of community differences to patterns in the physical and chemical environment (the latter also dictated by rank similarities between samples). Techniques are described that bring such a framework into place, and areas in which problems remain are identified. Accumulated practical experience with these methods is discussed, in particular applications to marine benthos, and it is concluded that they have much to offer practitioners of environmental impact studies on communities.},

Knowing the regional structure of ice variability during glaciations and deglaciations will clarify the mechanisms of the glacial cycle. Clark et al. (p. 710) compiled and analyzed more than 5000 radiocarbon and cosmogenic surface exposure ages in order to develop a record of maximum regional ice extent around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum. The responses of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres differed significantly, which reveals how the evolution of specific ice sheets affected sea level and provides insight into how insolation controlled the deglaciation.We used 5704 14C, 10Be, and 3He ages that span the interval from 10,000 to 50,000 years ago (10 to 50 ka) to constrain the timing of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in terms of global ice-sheet and mountain-glacier extent. Growth of the ice sheets to their maximum positions occurred between 33.0 and 26.5 ka in response to climate forcing from decreases in northern summer insolation, tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures, and atmospheric CO2. Nearly all ice sheets were at their LGM positions from 26.5 ka to 19 to 20 ka, corresponding to minima in these forcings. The onset of Northern Hemisphere deglaciation 19 to 20 ka was induced by an increase in northern summer insolation, providing the source for an abrupt rise in sea level. The onset of deglaciation of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet occurred between 14 and 15 ka, consistent with evidence that this was the primary source for an abrupt rise in sea level {\textasciitilde}14.5 ka.}

The actions set out in each target need to be initiated immediately and completed by 2030. Together, the results will enable achievement towards the outcome-oriented goals for 2050. Actions to reach these targets should be implemented consistently and in harmony with the Convention on Biological Diversity and its Protocols and other relevant international obligations, taking into account national circumstances, priorities and socioeconomic conditions. ~ 1. Reducing threats to biodiversity ~ TARGET 1 Ensure that all areas are under participatory integrated biodiversity inclusive spatial planning and/or effective management processes addressing land and sea use change, to bring the loss of areas of high biodiversity importance, including ecosystems of high ecological integrity, close to zero by 2030, while respecting the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities. TARGET 2 Ensure that by 2030 at least 30 per cent of areas of degraded terrestrial, inland water, and coastal and marine ecosystems are under effective restoration, in order to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services, ecological integrity and connectivity. TARGET 3 Ensure and enable that by 2030 at least 30 per cent of terrestrial, inland water,and of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services, are effectively conserved and managed through ecologically representative, well-connected and equitably governed systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, recognizing indigenous and traditional territories, where applicable,and integrated into wider landscapes, seascapes and the ocean, while ensuring that any sustainable use, where appropriate in such areas, is fully consistent with conservation outcomes, recognizing and respecting the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities including over their traditional territories. TARGET 4 Ensure urgent management actions, to halt human induced extinction of known threatened species and for the recovery and conservation of species, in particular threatened species, to significantly reduce extinction risk, as well as to maintain and restore the genetic diversity within and between populations of native, wild and domesticated species to maintain their adaptive potential, including through in situ and ex situ conservation and sustainable management practices, and effectively manage human-wildlife interactions to minimize human-wildlife conflict for coexistence. TARGET 5 Ensure that the use, harvesting and trade of wild species is sustainable, safe and legal, preventing overexploitation, minimizing impacts on non-target species and ecosystems, and reducing the risk of pathogen spill-over, applying the ecosystem approach, while respecting and protecting customary sustainable use by indigenous peoples and local communities.

With 196 Parties, the CBD has near universal participation among countries. The Convention seeks to address all threats to biodiversity and ecosystem services,including: threats from climate change, through scientific assessments, the development of tools, incentives and processes, the transfer of technologies and good practices and the full and active involvement of relevant stakeholders including indigenous peoples and local communities, youth, women, NGOs, sub-national actors and the business community. The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-Sharing are supplementary agreements to the CBD. The Cartagena Protocol, which entered into force 11 September 2003, seeks to protect biodiversity from the potential risks posed by living modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnology. To date, 173 Parties have ratified the Cartagena Protocol. The Nagoya Protocol aims to hare the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources in a fair and equitable way, including by appropriate access to genetic resources and by appropriate transfer of relevant technologies. Entering into force 12 October 2014, it has been ratified by 135 Parties.

  abstract = {Question Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) restoration is an important management objective throughout the southeastern United States. Site preparation prior to planting longleaf pine seedlings is often required to overcome challenges to seedling establishment on hydric sites. We know site preparation improves growth and survival of planted longleaf pine on hydric sites, but what are the impacts of site preparation on the understorey plant community? Location Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in Onslow County, NC, USA. Methods This study tested eight site preparation treatments, including an untreated control, six combinations of two vegetation control treatments (chopping or herbicide) with three soil manipulation treatments (mounding, bedding, or flat-planting [no treatment]), and a chopping--herbicide--bedding treatment. We collected data on understorey plant abundance, diversity, and composition through the first three and at 15 years after plantation establishment. We used ANOVA procedures and multivariate ordination to test for differences in understorey responses among the study treatments and through time. Results Site preparation had lasting impacts on the understorey plant community. The chop-only treatment was the only treatment that resulted in dominance of herbaceous vegetation and was among the treatments with the highest diversity and greatest abundance of Aristida stricta (wiregrass). Herbicide produced lasting reductions in Aristida stricta abundance and apparent shifts in community composition. Reduced graminoid abundance was particularly pronounced when herbicide was combined with soil manipulation treatments. Conclusions Understorey responses to site preparation through 3 years differed from responses observed in year 15, highlighting the importance of long-term monitoring. For example, herbicides controlled shrubs early, but by year 15, herbicide treatments were dominated by shrubs. Restoration scenarios often must balance ecological objectives (e.g., maintenance of a diverse understorey community) with forestry objectives (e.g., timely establishment of overstorey trees), and our findings can be used as a guide to balance these trade-offs.},

The Dirichlet-multinomial distribution has been proposed as a suitable candidate distribution for the joint species distribution of pin-point plant cover data and is here applied in a model-based ordination framework. Unlike most model-based ordination methods, both fixed and random effects are in our proposed model structured as p-dimensional vectors and added to the latent variables before multiplying with the species-specific coefficients. This changes the interpretation of the parameters, so that the fixed and random effects now measure the relative displacement of the vegetation by the fixed and random factors in the p-dimensional latent variable space. This parameterization allows statistical inference of the effect of fixed and random factors in vector space, and makes it easier for practitioners to perform inferences on species composition in a multivariate setting. The method was applied on plant pin-point cover data from dry heathlands that had received different management treatments (burned, grazed, harvested, unmanaged), and it was found that treatment have a significant effect on heathland vegetation both when considering plant functional groups or when the taxonomic resolution was at the species level.},

The precocious economy, unusual environment, and dynamic intellectual culture of the Dutch Republic in its seventeenth-century Golden Age allowed it to thrive as neighboring societies unraveled in the face of extremes in temperature and precipitation. By tracing the occasionally counterintuitive manifestations of climate change from global to local scales, Degroot finds that the Little Ice Age presented not only challenges for Dutch citizens but also opportunities that they aggressively exploited in conducting commerce, waging war, and creating culture. The overall success of their Republic in coping with climate change offers lessons that we would be wise to heed today, as we confront the growing crisis of global warming.},

  abstract = {Utilizing ecosystems' natural recovery potential is crucial for enhancing the scale and efficacy of restoration efforts. However, this potential is currently underutilized in restoration ecology, and barriers to natural species recruitment remain poorly understood. In this study, we develop an analytical framework that combines trait-based and dark diversity approaches to evaluate understory plant community recovery in smelter-impacted forests and identify factors limiting recovery for absent species. A community completeness index (CCI) was calculated in 18 naturally recovering smelter-impacted forests and three reference forests in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. The CCI was used to identify sites that deviate the most from their target communities and was compared to traditionally used indicators of plant recovery. Community weighted means (CWM) of traits for observed and dark diversity species were compared, and principal components analysis was used to identify relationships between traits of observed and missing species among study sites. Species unable to recover passively (i.e. with high dark diversity probabilities) were generally tall and/or large seeded. Understory plant community recovery was structured along two functional gradients, plant economics and size, which both coincided with distance to the smelter. Dark diversity and trait analyses were useful for identifying barriers to natural recovery and, therefore, providing guidance on targeted restoration actions. We conclude by discussing the limitations and opportunities of the dark diversity approach in a restoration context, highlighting the importance of carefully defining habitat-specific species pools and critically assessing the ecological significance of dark diversity probabilities.},

  abstract = {Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) is a powerful statistical tool which enables complex multivariate data sets to be visualized in a reduced number of dimensions. Users typically evaluate the fit of an NMDS ordination via ordination ``stress'' (i.e., data distortion) against a commonly accepted set of heuristic guidelines. However, these guidelines do not account for the mathematical relationship which links ordination stress to sample size. Consequently, researchers working with large data sets may unnecessarily present ordinations in an intractable number of dimensions, subdivide their data, or forego the use of NMDS entirely and lose the benefits of this highly flexible and useful technique. In order to overcome the limitations of these practices, we advocate for an alternative approach to the evaluation of NMDS ordination fit via the usage of permutation-based ecological null models. We present the rationale for this approach from a theoretical basis, supported by a brief literature review, and an example usage of the methodology. Our literature review shows that NMDS analyses often far exceed the number of observations under which the original stress guidelines were formulated---with a significant increasing trend in recent decades. Adoption of a permutation-based approach will consequently provide a more flexible and quantitative evaluation of NMDS fit and allow for the continued application of NMDS in an era of increasingly large datasets.},

The period studied covers both historical, for which there is documentary evidence of impacts, and prehistorical events, for which impacts are inferred from the archeological record. Drought appears to be the most common high-impact stressor in the historical and prehistorical records. Clearly, the adequacy of water supplies for growing food and for an array of other uses is a thread that weaves its way across time and societies. We also briefly outline some of the key physical mechanisms leading to climatic changes of a magnitude that could have led to societal disruptions. These include solar variability and large explosive volcanic eruptions, both of which affect the amount of radiant energy available to the Earth's climate system, as well as the natural internal variability of the climate system. We emphasize that climatic changes alone are unlikely to be the sole determinant cause of a given society's response ? whether abandonment of settlements or bellicose action against its own members or neighbors. Often, the natural hazard is simply a catalyst for actions whose groundwork had been set in motion for some time prior. In many cases, appropriate mitigation to reduce vulnerability and efforts to enhance a society's adaptive capacity might have been enough to prevent the most extreme consequences of the nature's extremes. In that vein, we point to current conditions in the western United States, where a complex mix of past and current actions together with a rapidly changing climate are causing a plethora of problems whose solution will demand creative collaborative actions at all levels of society.}

  abstract = {Background: Flipped classroom, which is inversion of conventional classroom procedures in simple terms, currently stands out as a popular teaching strategy for many Science courses. Purpose: In this article, we tried to make a reinterpretation of the findings of recent empirical studies conducted on the effectiveness of the flipped classroom approach in science education. Design and Methods: To determine the overall effect size of the flipped classroom implementations in Science courses, a meta-analysis of 30 studies with such moderator variables as education levels, durations of implementations, various subjects areas of science and class sizes was carried out. To consolidate the academic achievement theme dwelled on in the meta-analysis part, a meta-thematic analysis based on document analysis of qualitative studies was conducted to expound in detail general characteristics of the approach, its effect on academic dimension, its contribution to the affective domain and classroom environment. Results: The findings reveal that the flipped classroom implementations have a positive medium effect (g~=~0.727) on academic achievement in Science classes. Physics and Chemistry classes have the highest effect size values while Biology has the lowest effect size; the flipped classroom practices proved best in small size classes and at Primary School level with the highest effect sizes. Conclusions: The findings of both analyses provide insights into applicability of the approach in teaching of Science and its sub-branches. The drawbacks of the approach are also discussed with some suggestions for implication.},

  abstract = {Large-scale rewilding has been proposed as an effective method to combat the global biodiversity crisis, although there is a lack of data to support this. Rewilding generally refers to a process that allows nature to recover by reducing human interference, without the predefined end-goal that more traditional restoration projects usually have. The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ) is perhaps the most famous example of passive rewilding (rewilding with little or no management), but until now, most research has focused on the impact of radiation on wildlife rather than on rewilding. Here, we analyze species composition change of raptors in the Belarusian CEZ over a 22-year period, starting 12 years after the accident, alongside national raptor monitoring data. Generalist and farmland-associated mesopredators, super-abundant at the beginning of our study, strongly declined, as open habitats (former agricultural land) rewetted or became overgrown. Increase in waterlogged areas saw wetland specialists increase in abundance, including two species locally extinct from the area before the accident: Greater Spotted Eagle (Endangered in Europe) and White-tailed Eagle. Greater Spotted Eagles are an indicator of wetland habitat quality, and while declining throughout Europe in recent decades, they have increased from zero to at least 13 pairs, over the whole Belarusian CEZ. Our research is evidence that rewilding could be an effective way of restoring species and species interactions found in near-natural habitats, and if human interferences in ecological processes are reduced, a priori restoration goals and continued management are not always necessary to conserve threatened species.},

  abstract = {The structural characteristics of the macroinvertebrate community can effectively reflect the health status of lake ecosystems and the quality of the lake ecological environment. It is therefore important to identify the limiting factors of macroinvertebrate community structure for the maintenance of lake ecosystem health. In this study, the community composition of macroinvertebrate assemblages and their relationships with environmental variables were investigated in 13 small lakes within Lianhuan Lake in northern China. A self-organizing map and K-means clustering analysis grouped the macroinvertebrate communities into five groups, and the indicator species reflected the environmental characteristics of each group. Principal component analysis indicated that the classification of the macroinvertebrate communities was affected by environmental variables. The Kruskal--Wallis test results showed that environmental variables (pH, total phosphorus, nitrate, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, permanganate index, and ammonium) had a significant effect on the classification of the macroinvertebrate communities. Redundancy analysis showed that mollusks were significantly negatively correlated with pH and chlorophyll a, while annelids and aquatic insects were significantly positively correlated with chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen. Spearman correlation analysis showed that the species richness and Shannon's diversity of macroinvertebrates were significantly negatively correlated with total phosphorus, while the biomass of macroinvertebrates was significantly negatively correlated with pH. High alkalinity and lake eutrophication have a serious impact on the macroinvertebrate community. Human disturbances, such as industrial and agricultural runoff, negatively impact the ecological environment and affect macroinvertebrate community structure. Thus, macroinvertebrate community structure should be improved by enhancing the ecological environment and controlling environmental pollution at a watershed scale.},

  abstract = {Aims Ecological strategies can provide information about plant community assembly and its main drivers. Our aim was to reveal the dominant strategies of the vegetation types of forest--grassland mosaics and to deduce the assembly processes responsible for their species composition. Location Hungary. Methods We investigated eight vegetation types of Hungarian forest--steppes. The trade-off between three key traits related to leaf size and economics was used to calculate Grime's competitive--stress tolerance--ruderal (CSR) value for each species, based on which the mean value for each vegetation type was determined. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) ordination was used to reveal the compositional differences among the vegetation types under study. To analyze how ecological strategies correlate with the compositional gradient, we used linear regression between plot ordination scores (the first DCA scores) and each strategy (C, S, and R). Linear mixed-effect models were used to evaluate the differences between the vegetation types regarding each strategy (C, S, and R). Results Each vegetation type was dominated by the stress-tolerator strategy, indicating the prominent role of environmental filtering in community assembly. However, ecological strategies differed significantly among the communities. The importance of the stress-tolerator strategy decreased toward the less harsh end of the gradient (i.e., from grasslands to forests), while the competitor strategy showed a reverse pattern. The ruderal strategy was weakly correlated with the gradient, although its proportion increased toward the harsh end of the gradient. Conclusions With ongoing climate change, an increasing importance of environmental filtering is expected in the assembly of the vegetation types in the studied forest--grassland mosaics. We suggest that CSR strategies offer a useful tool for studying plant-community assembly rules along environmental gradients.},

  abstract = {Urbanization has been recognized as one of the most widespread threats to biodiversity. However, the response of wildlife to urbanization differs among groups, with many species being able to persist, adapt, and even thrive in these novel ecosystems. With the aim of assessing the response of avian communities in a neotropical green city, we evaluated their species richness and composition across a gradient of urbanization density comprised by a citywide survey performed in two consecutive years and considering both breeding and non-breeding seasons. As expected, species richness decreased with urbanization. Species loss was drastic when considering data from both years and both seasons, and gradual when seasons were assessed separately. Avian composition for both years and seasons differed largely between the less urbanized and the more urbanized sites, whereas sites with intermediate built cover showed to be more similar to each other. When evaluating avian composition by season in both years, highest differences were recorded between more urbanized sites and all other studied sites, while less urbanized sites showed high similarity regardless of the surveyed season. Sites with intermediate built cover had higher similarity among seasons, showing that such conditions shelter similar species in both seasons. This study presents findings on one of the first citywide gradients of urbanization density from the urban Neotropics, showing both differences and similarities in relation to previous studies from the Global North. Briefly, our species richness results showed a punctuated decrease when considering both seasons and years, rather than a gradual decrease or humped-shaped relations with higher richness at intermediately urbanized sites. Also, our composition findings stress the high representation of insectivore birds as part of avian communities across a citywide gradient of urbanization density. Undoubtedly, identifying the similarities and differences in the urban ecology patterns across cities, together with the particularities some urban systems, will allow for increased effectiveness of urban management and planning strategies in the transformation toward more livable, resilient, and biodiverse cities.},

  abstract = {Abstract: More than 200 000 ring-width measurements from 384 trees were obtained for 20 individual sites ranging from the lower to upper local timber-lines in the Northwest Karakorum of Pakistan and the Southern Tien Shan of Kirghizia. Samples were obtained predominantly from juniper species (Juniperus) and were analysed to reconstruct regional climatic variation patterns in Western Central Asia since ad 618. Site distribution represents diverse ecological conditions (e.g., combinations of temperature and moisture stress) within the Karakorum and Tien Shan mountains, permitting both intra-montane and inter-montane comparisons of chronologies. Three different types of chronologies re ecting interannual-, decadal- and centennial-scale ringwidth variations were calculated: a statistic skeleton-plotting technique was used to identify ring-width pointer years (interannual); a 101-year kernel  lter was used to identify decadal-scale variations; and, for a subset of long-lived trees, the mean ring-width of the entire single series was used to identify centennial trends. After extracting and calibrating each of these three distinct wavelengths in ring-width variation, the results were combined into a comprehensive reconstruction re ecting primarily temperature  uctuations in Western Central Asia since ad 618. The nature and the temporally changing strength of the climatic signals of this reconstruction are discussed in detail. A maximum latewood density record of Pinus tienschanica from Central Tien Shan was used as a predictor series to calibrate and validate tree-ring-width variation. In so doing, we link our results to the circumpolar maximum latewood-density network (Briffa et al., 1998a; 1998b; Schweingruber and Briffa, 1996).},

Broad attribute categories could be necessary due to the large variety of restoration projects, but could make overall evaluations and assessments challenging and might hamper the development of sound and successful restoration. In this study we carry out a systematic review of scientific papers addressing evaluation of restoration outcome. We include 104 studies published after 2010 from Europe or North America, representing different types of restoration projects in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. We explore the main ecological and socioeconomic attributes used to evaluate restoration outcome, and related indicators and specific methods applied to measure this, in relation to ecosystem and type of restoration project. We identify a wide range of indicators within each attribute, and show that very different methods are employed to measure them. This complexity reduces the opportunity for meaningful comparison and standardization of evaluation of restoration outcome, within and between ecosystems. Socioeconomic indicators are rarely used to evaluate restoration outcome, and studies including both ecological and socioeconomic indicators are nearly absent. Based on our findings we discuss whether standardization and streamlining of indicators is useful to improve the evaluation of ``on the ground'' restoration, or if this is not appropriate given the diversity of goals and ecosystems involved. Species-specific traits are used in many projects and should be considered as an addition to the original SER attributes. Furthermore, we discuss the potential for restoration evaluation that encompasses not only assessment of ecological but also socioeconomic indicators.},

  abstract = {Alpine areas worldwide are under heavy land-use pressure and degradation. Active restoration treatments can contribute to accelerating recovery of degraded areas. However, monitoring data are needed to understand the contribution of restoration treatments to long-term management and to predict time to recovery (TR). In this study, we used monitoring data on removed roads in an alpine area in Norway to investigate TR of three vegetation-based indicators. Four restoration treatments were tested: 1) removal of added gravel down to original terrain surface, and stirring of topsoil; 2) adding fertilizer to the stirred topsoil; 3) adding seeds to the fertilized topsoil; and 4) no removal of added gravel, but stirring of top layer (gravel and soil). The restoration of roads took place in 2002, and monitoring of permanent plots was carried out in 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2019. Reference plots in intact vegetation next to removed roads were monitored in 2014 and 2019. We used species composition and species richness of vascular plants as well as total vegetation cover as indicators of restoration outcome and investigated predicted TR for these indicators under different restoration treatments. Species composition changed significantly with time since restoration in all treatments, approaching that of the reference vegetation. The recovery of species composition was slowest in fertilized and seeded plots, where estimated TR was 2-3 times longer ({$>$} 45 years) than in the other treatments ({$<$} 20 years). Species richness of vascular plants was restored quickly ({$<$} 5 years) within all restoration treatments, whereas recovery of vegetation cover varied more (20-30 years). Our study confirms that vegetation recovery in alpine environments is a long-term process, but that adding seeds and nutrients is unnecessary for, and even inhibits, the recovery of narrow, disturbed sites such as former roads.},

  abstract = {Agricultural management has a great influence on biodiversity and its services in agroecosystems. In Europe, a relevant proportion of biodiversity is dependent on low-input agriculture. To assess the effects of agricultural management on biodiversity, in this study we surveyed the communities of arable plants, diurnal flying insects, and pollinators in three conventional and in two organic fields of a traditional Elephant garlic (Allium ampeloprasum L.) crop of the Valdichiana area, in Tuscany (central Italy). The sampling was carried out twice during the season: in spring, during crop growing, and in summer, after crop harvesting. We assessed the effects of the different agricultural management on the richness and composition (species occurrence and abundance) of the three communities using univariate and multivariate analyses. Concerning our specific case study,~only plant species richness was significantly higher in organic fields (15.7\,{\textpm}\,2.7 species per plot), compared to conventional ones (5.4\,{\textpm}\,2.3 species per plot). Regarding community composition, only pollinators showed a marginally significant difference between conventional and organic fields. Conversely, the effect of specific fields significantly explained differences in composition of all the investigated groups (plants, total insects, and~pollinators). The results suggest that, in our case study, the emerged differences in diversity of the investigated communities were mainly attributable to environmental and management factors related to single fields, more than to organic or conventional farming. Such evidence could be partly due to the very local scale of the study, to the heterogeneity of the surveyed fields, and to the reduced number of surveyed fields. Further investigation is therefore needed.},

  abstract = {Questions It is well documented that invasive alien plants can reduce species richness and diversity and modify the composition of invaded communities. However, our knowledge on the impacts of invasive alien plants on the community functional structure and ecosystem properties and the mechanisms underlying these changes is more limited. We evaluated how the community functional structure and ecosystem properties change along a gradient of Ligustrum lucidum abundance. Location Subtropical mountain forest in NW Argentina. Methods We conducted tree vegetation sampling in 164 plots distributed along a gradient of L. lucidum abundance. For L. lucidum and for the most abundant tree species in these plots we estimated six functional traits (specific leaf area, leaf tensile strength, leaf nitrogen concentration, leaf water potential, wood density and maximum plant height), as well as their relative growth rates. Then, we calculated indices of community functional structure (community-weighted means for each trait; richness, evenness, divergence and dispersion). We explored the extent to which the invasive success of L. lucidum and its impact may be attributed to niche differentiation or to fitness superiority. Finally, we explored how L. lucidum abundance alters ecosystem properties. Results Some indicators of community functional structure changed linearly while others tended to saturate along the invasion gradient. L. lucidum has a higher growth rate than resident species and it lays close to the periphery, but within the limits of the functional space defined by resident trees. L. lucidum tends to displace more functionally similar resident species. Soil moisture and N content declined, while soil C:N increased with L. lucidum abundance. Conclusions Our findings suggest that both niche differentiation and fitness superiority contribute to explain the invasion success of L. lucidum and the changes in functional structure of the community along the gradient of L. lucidum abundance with evident impacts on ecosystem properties.},

Given that high elevations are undergoing enhanced warming and alpine ecosystems provide important services, we ask: Have alpine grasslands experienced rapid vegetation changes over the last five years? Which species are more sensitive to warmer and/or drier conditions? Location Carex curvula grassland in the southern Alps (Italy). Methods Species cover was visually estimated in 20 permanent plots, including both control and climate-manipulated plots, during the period 2017--2022. Climate manipulations, that is, increased temperature and/or reduced precipitation during the snow-free period, started from 2018. Principal component analysis, redundancy analysis and generalised least-squares or linear mixed-effect models were employed to investigate variations in species assemblage and species-specific responses. Results Detectable changes were found in species cover over time and between climate manipulations, with warmed plots experiencing greater shifts in species composition compared to controls. At the species level, however, both increases and decreases in cover were observed over time, with only two non-dominant forbs, Phyteuma hemisphaericum and Leucanthemopsis alpina, showing either increased cover in warmed plots or lower cover values under drier conditions. No treatment effects and the lowest variation across years were found for the two dominant species (the sedge Carex curvula and the forb Alchemilla pentaphyllea) which together make up more than 70\% of vascular plant cover. Despite the short time period investigated, a major cover reduction was observed in all treatments for some snowbed species. Conclusions The plant species assemblage of the target alpine grassland was found to be sensitive to short-term manipulations simulating future climate changes, with individual species exhibiting idiosyncratic responses to manipulations and different cover dynamics over time. A decline in some snowbed specialists already seems to be taking place even in these late-successional grasslands --- at a rate likely to increase in the future --- with the majority of other vascular species exhibiting greater resistance to changing environmental conditions.},

The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6\% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes---although the greatest effects are in small (n {$\leq$} 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the problem of scaling the proposal distribution of a multidimensional random walk Metropolis algorithm in order to maximize the efficiency of the algorithm. The main result is a weak convergence result as the dimension of a sequence of target densities, n, converges to \${\textbackslash}infty\$. When the proposal variance is appropriately scaled according to n, the sequence of stochastic processes formed by the first component of each Markov chain converges to the appropriate limiting Langevin diffusion process. The limiting diffusion approximation admits a straightforward efficiency maximization problem, and the resulting asymptotically optimal policy is related to the asymptotic acceptance rate of proposed moves for the algorithm. The asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is 0.234 under quite general conditions. The main result is proved in the case where the target density has a symmetric product form. Extensions of the result are discussed.},

  abstract = {Scoring rules assess the quality of probabilistic forecasts, by assigning a numerical score based on the predictive distribution and on the event or value that materializes. A scoring rule is proper if the forecaster maximizes the expected score for an observation drawn from the distributionF if he or she issues the probabilistic forecast F, rather than G {$\neq$} F. It is strictly proper if the maximum is unique. In prediction problems, proper scoring rules encourage the forecaster to make careful assessments and to be honest. In estimation problems, strictly proper scoring rules provide attractive loss and utility functions that can be tailored to the problem at hand. This article reviews and develops the theory of proper scoring rules on general probability spaces, and proposes and discusses examples thereof. Proper scoring rules derive from convex functions and relate to information measures, entropy functions, and Bregman divergences. In the case of categorical variables, we prove a rigorous version of the Savage representation. Examples of scoring rules for probabilistic forecasts in the form of predictive densities include the logarithmic, spherical, pseudospherical, and quadratic scores. The continuous ranked probability score applies to probabilistic forecasts that take the form of predictive cumulative distribution functions. It generalizes the absolute error and forms a special case of a new and very general type of score, the energy score. Like many other scoring rules, the energy score admits a kernel representation in terms of negative definite functions, with links to inequalities of Hoeffding type, in both univariate and multivariate settings. Proper scoring rules for quantile and interval forecasts are also discussed. We relate proper scoring rules to Bayes factors and to cross-validation, and propose a novel form of cross-validation known as random-fold cross-validation. A case study on probabilistic weather forecasts in the North American Pacific Northwest illustrates the importance of propriety. We note optimum score approaches to point and quantile estimation, and propose the intuitively appealing interval score as a utility function in interval estimation that addresses width as well as coverage.},

  abstract = {In Central Europe, natural forest disturbance is increasing due to climate change and the legacies of past forest management. The resulting early successional forest stages shape habitat conditions and availability for forest-dwelling species. How disturbance, pre-disturbance forest management such as beech underplanting in conifer stands and post-disturbance management, such as salvage logging, shape biodiversity is poorly understood. In a large field study, we quantified how the large-scale loss of mature spruce plantations after natural disturbance affects bird diversity and abundance in Central Europe and how this is moderated by pre- and post- disturbance management. In a Bayesian community distance sampling approach, we conducted field surveys on 182 plots in a stratified design, comparing bark beetle and windthrow disturbances as well as two management treatments, (i) underplanting with beech before the disturbance occurred versus no underplanting and (ii) salvage logging versus no post-disturbance logging. We used undisturbed mature spruce plantations as a control. Bird diversity was higher in disturbed forests than in undisturbed spruce plantations and was affected little by management. Bayesian community distance sampling models revealed that responses were highly species-specific: shrub-associated birds profited from disturbance in general and reached highest densities where beech had been planted under the spruce canopy before the disturbance occurred, whereas open-habitat and farmland birds reached higher densities on salvage-logged sites. Only few typical species of coniferous forests persisted at disturbed sites. Synthesis and applications. With increasing forest disturbance, pre- and post-disturbance management can promote target bird species. Shrub-associated species can be promoted by underplanting, open habitat-adapted species by salvage logging and species depending on vertical structures by no intervention. For maximising biodiversity benefits at a landscape scale, underrepresented management practices (no intervention) should be promoted to ensure a balanced forest management and to maintain diverse post-disturbance bird communities.},

With the rise of evidence-base medicine and increasing numbers of published systematic reviews, criteria for assessing the quality of reporting have been developed. First QUOROM (Lancet 354:1896--1900, 1999) and then PRISMA (Ann Intern Med 151:264, 2009) were developed as reporting guidelines and standards to ensure medical meta-analyses and systematic reviews are reported to a high level of detail. PRISMA is now widely used by a range of journals as a pre-submission checklist. However, due to its development for systematic reviews in healthcare, PRISMA has limited applicability for reviews in conservation and environmental management. We highlight 12 key problems with the application of PRISMA to this field, including an overemphasis on meta-analysis and no consideration for other synthesis methods. We introduce ROSES (RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses), a pro forma and flow diagram designed specifically for systematic reviews and systematic maps in the field of conservation and environmental management. We describe how ROSES solves the problems with PRISMA. We outline the key benefits of our approach to designing ROSES, in particular the level of detail and inclusion of rich guidance statements. We also introduce the extraction of meta-data that describe key aspects of the conduct of the review. Collated together, this summary record can help to facilitate rapid review and appraisal of the conduct of a systematic review or map, potentially speeding up the peer-review process. We present the results of initial road testing of ROSES with systematic review experts, and propose a plan for future development of ROSES.},

We used a screening approach to evaluate vegetation development in 295 construction sites related to upkeeping of the national power grid in Norway and assessed if and how active measures for vegetation recovery can contribute to mitigate negative impacts on biodiversity and natural carbon storage. Bayesian networks were developed to assess the effect of interventions on the vegetation cover, and an ensemble learning algorithm (Boruta) was used to assess variable importance. Multivariate analysis was run to investigate plant functional group composition. The screening approach uncovered some broad results; A large diversity of installation types are associated with gridline-systems, and the large variation of mitigation measures are hard to classify and evaluate. Years since restoration, region and site ID were important to explain the total vegetation cover, while restoration treatment, soil and installation type were not important. Graminoids dominate the total vegetation cover, in both seeded and non-seeded sites. More detailed studies will contribute to more accurate evaluation of different measures and vegetation recovery. Lack of documentation and well-designed monitoring hamper the development of reliable procedures of mitigation in construction projects, as the ecological outcome of the efforts can be questioned.},

Large-scale and complex restoration projects need new perspectives on goal formulation, indicators for success, and evaluation to encompass both scientific approaches and the tacit knowledge held by practitioners. The objective of this paper is to use the restoration of a 165~km2 former military training area in alpine central Norway into National Park to demonstrate the challenges of upscaling and integration. Main tasks were to remove roads and technical infrastructure, prepare for natural recovery and remove undetonated ordnance. In total, 19 indicators were used to evaluate the restoration outcome, related to four overall restoration goals formulated by the Norwegian Parliament: nature protection, considerable nature benefit, safe civilian use, and restoration back to natural state. Despite an overall linear project cycle, a dynamic and adaptive process of planning, implementation and evaluation was performed at the individual site scale. A dynamic dialogue between all involved professions allowed for exchanging scientific and tacit knowledge, and continuous improvement of solutions. The study demonstrated the relevance of qualitative assessments combined with quantitative indicators -- i.e., use of expert opinions and the continuous evaluation to feed back into planning and improving the implementation of restoration measures. A ``Green training'' procedure was developed, linking top-down formally defined settings of the project with bottom-up hand-on solutions. This procedure can be directly transferred to other large-scale mitigation and restoration projects. Demonstration sites like the one described here, are valuable to develop an expanded vision of restoration to meet the UN Sustainable Goals.},

  abstract = {AbstractAfter massive proliferation over the last decade, distribution modelling (DM) -- research with the purpose of modelling the distribution of observable objects of a specific type -- has grown into an independent branch of ecological science. There is consensus that this new discipline needs a stronger theoretical foundation. I describe DM as an inductive scientific process with 12 steps, organised into three composite steps: ecological model, data model, and statistical model. Step 8, modelling of the overall ecological response, places DM unambiguously among gradient analysis techniques and motivates for a gradient analytic (GA) perspective on DM. DM terminology is reviewed and revised accordingly. Three fundamental insights of the GA perspective are described: (1) that external `factors' do not influence the species one by one, but act on the species in concert; (2) that a few major complex-gradients normally account for most of the variation in species composition that can be explained environmentally; and (3) that species occur within a restricted interval along each major complex-gradient. These insights are developed into a theoretical platform for DM. General patterns of species performance variation along environmental complex-gradients and the structuring processes responsible for these patterns are reviewed. Three categories of ecoclines, i.e., gradients of variation in species composition and the environment, are recognised: regional ecoclines, local ecoclines, and condition},

  abstract = {Multiple ecological drivers, along with forest age, determine the species composition of boreal forest ecosystems. However, the role of age in successional changes in forests cannot be understood without taking site conditions, the disturbance regime and forest structure into account. In this study, we ask two research questions: 1. What is the relationship between forest age and overall species composition in older near-natural spruce forests, i.e. forests of age beyond harvest maturity? 2. Do species associated with different forest habitats respond similarly to variation in forest age? Data were collected in 257 Norway spruce dominated 0.25\,ha plots from three study areas in Southeastern and Central Norway. Species inventories were conducted for lichens and bryophytes on trees and rocks, vascular plants on the forest floor, and for deadwood-associated bryophytes and polypore fungi. Although NMDS ordination analyses of the total species composition identified a main axis related to the age of the oldest trees in two of the study areas, variation partitioning analyses showed that age explained a small fraction of variation of the species composition compared to site conditions, logging history, forest structure, and differences between the sites in all habitats. The unique variation explained by forest age species was, however, significant for all habitats. The fraction of variation in species composition explained by forest age was the largest for lichens and bryophytes on trees, and for deadwood-associated bryophytes and polypore fungi. Our results suggest that practical mapping of near-natural forests for management purposes inventories should include site conditions, forest structure and between site differences in addition to forest age.},

We selected three annual alien plants, widespread in the riparian habitats of the Kruger National Park, South Africa: Datura innoxia, Parthenium hysterophorus, and Xanthium strumarium, to examine their potential impacts on riparian plant communities. We identified 12--13 populations for each and placed a pair of invaded and uninvaded plots in each population. Species richness, Shannon diversity, and Pielou evenness were compared between the invaded and uninvaded plots using LMM models, and species composition was compared using ordination. The invaded vegetation showed lower species richness compared to the uninvaded, with the strongest effect observed for P. hysterophorus. The invaded plots also showed lower Shannon diversity and Pielou evenness due to the presence of alien dominants. For all three invaders, the invasion resulted in changes in the composition of native vegetation. Some native plants were more frequent and abundant in the invaded vegetation, possibly due to the habitats created in sandy river beds. The native species richness decreased with increasing invader cover, but the species richness of aliens accompanying the invasive dominants was not negatively affected by their cover. Our results confirmed the negative impact of invasive aliens on native plant diversity, with the most pronounced effect by Parthenium hysterophorus invasions.},

  abstract = {Industrialization has ushered in massive changes in agriculture. Particularly in low mountain ranges, large-scale afforestation with Norway spruce on traditionally managed, semi-natural grasslands has caused a severe decline in biodiversity. Tree removal, hay transfer and resumption of grazing or mowing are typical measures to re-create species-rich grasslands. The aim of this study was to use vascular plants and three insect taxa (leafhoppers, true bugs and grasshoppers) as bioindicators to evaluate the success of montane grassland restoration on former spruce forests in Central Europe. In addition, we intended to identify the drivers of species richness within the studied grasslands in order to derive suitable recommendations for habitat management. We analyzed two different treatments: (i) grazed restoration sites where trees had been cut and species-rich green hay had been applied (N = 9) and (ii) target sites with a long continuity of low-intensity grazing (N = 9).Our study revealed that all studied taxa responded rapidly to the restoration measures. After a development period of three to five years, we found no differences in species richness and diversity of leafhoppers, true bugs and grasshoppers (all, target and threatened species). In addition, non-metric multidimensional scaling showed a large overlap in species composition between restoration and target grasslands. Among target and threatened species, vascular plants displayed the same pattern as insects and reached similar values when comparing the two treatments. However, total species richness and diversity of vascular plants were still higher on the target sites and species composition overlapped only partially. Grazing intensity was the predictor with the highest explanatory power in multivariable (Generalized) Linear Mixed-effects Models, being negatively related to species richness of leafhoppers and true bugs. We conclude that the measures implemented were effective in re-establishing target communities of different taxa. The transfer of seed-containing hay enabled or accelerated the development of the vegetation. Insects, on the other hand, were able to recolonize the restored grasslands on their own, given that these sites were embedded in a network of species-rich grasslands. With regard to insects (e.g., leafhoppers and true bugs), it should be ensured that grazing is applied at low intensity.},

This study investigates the macroinvertebrate community structure of five conservation ponds south of Karlsruhe, Germany, to identify effects caused by this invasive crayfish. Two of the ponds had a high population density of F. immunis, two were expected to have lower crayfish densities as they had been habitat modified with gravelled water beds as a crayfish management approach, and one pond was known to be free of crayfish but contained fish. The macroinvertebrate communities were analyzed considering their species richness and composition. The relative density of F. immunis within the samples was regarded as a representative indicator for crayfish population density and tested for its influence on the ordination along with habitat composition and abiotic factors using distance-based redundancy analysis. F. immunis was identified as a driving factor of the macroinvertebrate communities of sampled ponds. Additionally, this study indicates that gravelling ground beds as a management method for invasive burrowing crayfish species does not significantly influence the community composition but can minimize indirect effects caused by F. immunis.},

  abstract = {G. Evelyn Hutchinson more than a half century ago proposed that one could characterize the ecological niche of a species as an abstract mapping of population dynamics onto an environmental space, the axes of which are abiotic and biotic factors that influence birth and death rates. If a habitat has conditions within a species' niche, a population should persist without immigration from external sources, whereas if conditions are outside the niche, it faces extinction. Analyses of species' niches are essential to understanding controls on species' geographical range limits and how these limits might shift in our rapidly changing world. Recent developments in ecology and evolutionary biology suggest it is time to revisit and refine Hutchinson's niche concept. After reviewing techniques for quantifying niches, I examine subtleties that arise because of impacts species have on their own environments, the density-dependent modulation of how individuals experience environments, and the interplay of dispersal and temporal heterogeneity in determining population persistence. Moreover, the evolutionary record over all time scales reveals a spectrum of rates of change in species' niches, from rapid niche evolution to profound niche conservatism. Substantial challenges revolving around the evolutionary dimension of the Hutchinsonian niche include quantifying the magnitude of evolved intraspecific and clade-level variation in niches and understanding the factors that govern where along the spectrum of potential evolutionary rates any given lineage lies. A growing body of theory provides elements of a conceptual framework for understanding niche conservatism and evolution, paving the way for an evolutionary theory of the niche.},

  abstract = {Fungi are key decomposers of deadwood, but the impact of anthropogenic changes in nutrients and temperature on fungal community and its consequences for wood microbial respiration are not well understood. Here, we examined how nitrogen and phosphorus additions (field experiment) and warming (laboratory experiment) together influence fungal composition and microbial respiration from decomposing wood of angiosperms and gymnosperms in a subtropical forest. Nutrient additions significantly increased wood microbial respiration via fungal composition, but effects varied with nutrient types and taxonomic groups. Specifically, phosphorus addition significantly increased wood microbial respiration (65\%) through decreased acid phosphatase activity and increased abundance of fast-decaying fungi (e.g., white rot), while nitrogen addition marginally increased it (30\%). Phosphorus addition caused a greater increase in microbial respiration in gymnosperms than in angiosperms (83.3\% vs. 46.9\%), which was associated with an increase in Basidiomycota:Ascomycota operational taxonomic unit abundance in gymnosperms but a decrease in angiosperms. The temperature dependencies of microbial respiration were remarkably constant across nutrient levels, consistent with metabolic scaling theory hypotheses. This is because there was no significant interaction between temperature and wood phosphorus availability or fungal composition, or the interaction among the three factors. Our results highlight the key role of tree identity in regulating nutrient response of wood microbial respiration through controlling fungal composition. Given that the range of angiosperm species may expand under climate warming and forest management, our data suggest that expansion will decrease nutrient effects on forest carbon cycling in forests previously dominated by gymnosperm species.},

Methods of unconstrained ordination currently used, such as non-metric multidimensional scaling, are algorithm-based techniques developed and implemented without directly accommodating the statistical properties of the data at hand. Failure to account for these key data properties can lead to misleading results. A model-based approach to unconstrained ordination can address this issue, and in this study, two types of models for ordination are proposed based on finite mixture models and latent variable models. Each method is capable of handling different data types and different forms of species response to latent gradients. Further strengths of the models are demonstrated via example and simulation. Advantages of model-based approaches to ordination include the following: residual analysis tools for checking assumptions to ensure the fitted model is appropriate for the data; model selection tools to choose the most appropriate model for ordination; methods for formal statistical inference to draw conclusions from the ordination; and improved efficiency, that is model-based ordination better recovers true relationships between sites, when used appropriately.},

Climate determinism previously offered an explanation, and hence a justification, for the superiority of certain imperial races and cultures. The argument put forward here is that the new climate reductionism is driven by the hegemony exercised by the predictive natural sciences over contingent, imaginative, and humanistic accounts of social life and visions of the future. It is a hegemony that lends disproportionate power in political and social discourse to model-based descriptions of putative future climates. Some possible reasons for this climate reductionism, as well as some of the limitations and dangers of this position for human relationships with the future, are suggested.}

However, patterns of changes in species diversity and composition in novel ecosystems over time remain poorly understood, making it unclear whether all novel ecosystems contribute to urban biodiversity. Here, we assessed how plant species diversity and composition in developed habitats changed over the years since the development of habitats (years since development) using a space-for-time substitution approach in the megacity, Tokyo, Japan. We established multiple survey transects at each study site to investigate the plant species diversity and composition. Using the ordination regression-based approach, we found that the plant species composition in developed habitats changed over the years since development and became similar to that in remnant habitats after approximately 130 years. We also found that the diversity of native plant species did not change whereas that of exotic species decreased with the years since development. Our results demonstrate the importance of developing new habitats for conserving urban biodiversity, while highlighting that exotic species can easily establish in newly developed habitats. Given that remnant ecosystems in urban areas are degraded by urbanization, the time required for novel ecosystems to become similar to remnant ecosystems is essential for predicting and conserving future urban ecosystems.},

  abstract = {In a flipped classroom model, learning of basic content is shifted before class while in-class time is used for concept application. Empirical and controlled research studies are lacking on the best strategies to provide the necessary pre-class content instruction. In this study, we tested three methods of pre-class content learning---interactive online tutorials, video lectures, and textbook-style readings---while holding the content and the in-class application activities constant. Identical introductory, non-majors biology classes were manipulated at both a public, open-enrollment institution and a private, highly selective institution. We found that video lectures offer a small advantage to overall student learning over interactive tutorials or textbook-style readings. Although our two populations differed in their ability to effectively learn from pre-class activities, through a student-centered flipped classroom approach, students at both institutions demonstrated equal learning gains by the final assessment. Potential reasons for some observed differences are suggested.},

  abstract = {Mounting evidence from proxy records suggests that variations in solar activity have played a significant role in triggering past climate changes. However, the mechanisms for sun-climate links remain a topic of debate. Here we present a high-resolution summer sea-surface temperature (SST) record covering the past 9300 yr from a site located at the present-day boundary between polar and Atlantic surface-water masses. The record is age constrained via the identification of 15 independently dated tephra markers from terrestrial archives, circumventing marine reservoir age variability problems. Our results indicate a close link between solar activity and SSTs in the northern North Atlantic during the past 4000 yr; they suggest that the climate system in this area is more susceptible to the influence of solar variations during cool periods with less vigorous ocean circulation. Furthermore, the high-resolution SST record indicates that climate in the North Atlantic regions follows solar activity variations on multidecadal to centennial time scales.}

General results on convolution and asymptotic normality of exponential dispersion models are presented. Asymptotic theory is discussed, including a new small-dispersion asymptotic framework, which extends the domain of application of large-sample theory. Procedures for constructing new exponential dispersion models for correlated data are introduced, including models for longitudinal data and variance components.

This is partly driven by a fallacious conviction that modelling is largely about mathematical skills and that, consequently, modellers can equally effectively apply their skills to problems in fields as diverse as physics/engineering and ecology/evolution. I discuss why this fallacy arises, and the many ways in which modelling in ecology or evolution is actually a very different endeavour from that in much of physics, even though the form of the equations deployed across disciplines is typically quite similar. Since modelling is not primarily about the mathematics but about the system being studied, I believe that a reasonable degree of comfort with models and modelling is important for those researchers in ecology and evolution who primarily undertake empirical studies, whether in the laboratory or the field. Equally, I suggest that researchers doing modelling in ecology and evolution, who were trained in the mathematical or physical sciences, need to understand the systems they attempt to model and also appreciate how modelling ecological and evolutionary processes differs from much of the modelling done in classical physics and allied fields. I also discuss what models are, whether modelling is subjective or objective, and what modelling entails if it is to meaningfully add to scientific understanding. This article is aimed primarily at young researchers interested in ecological and evolutionary questions, whether coming from a background in the biological or physical/mathematical sciences.},

  abstract = {Ecological data sets often record the abundance of species, together with a set of explanatory variables. Multivariate statistical methods are optimal to analyze such data and are thus frequently used in ecology for exploration, visualization, and inference. Most approaches are based on pairwise distance matrices instead of the sites-by-species matrix, which stands in stark contrast to univariate statistics, where data models, assuming specific distributions, are the norm. However, through advances in statistical theory and computational power, models for multivariate data have gained traction. Systematic simulation-based performance evaluations of these methods are important as guides for practitioners but still lacking. Here, we compare two model-based methods, multivariate generalized linear models (MvGLMs) and constrained quadratic ordination (CQO), with two distance-based methods, distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). We studied the performance of the methods to discriminate between causal variables and noise variables for 190 simulated data sets covering different sample sizes and data distributions. MvGLM and dbRDA differentiated accurately between causal and noise variables. The former had the lowest false-positive rate (0.008), while the latter had the lowest false-negative rate (0.027). CQO and CCA had the highest false-negative rate (0.291) and false-positive rate (0.256), respectively, where these error rates were typically high for data sets with linear responses. Our study shows that both model- and distance-based methods have their place in the ecologist's statistical toolbox. MvGLM and dbRDA are reliable for analyzing species--environment relations, whereas both CQO and CCA exhibited considerable flaws, especially with linear environmental gradients.},

  abstract = {Almost half a century after Whittaker (Ecol Monogr 30:279--338, 1960) proposed his influential diversity concept, it is time for a critical reappraisal. Although the terms alpha, beta and gamma diversity introduced by Whittaker have become general textbook knowledge, the concept suffers from several drawbacks. First, alpha and gamma diversity share the same characteristics and are differentiated only by the scale at which they are applied. However, as scale is relative----depending on the organism(s) or ecosystems investigated----this is not a meaningful ecological criterion. Alpha and gamma diversity can instead be grouped together under the term ``inventory diversity.'' Out of the three levels proposed by Whittaker, beta diversity is the one which receives the most contradictory comments regarding its usefulness (``key concept'' vs. ``abstruse concept''). Obviously beta diversity means different things to different people. Apart from the large variety of methods used to investigate it, the main reason for this may be different underlying data characteristics. A literature review reveals that the multitude of measures used to assess beta diversity can be sorted into two conceptually different groups. The first group directly takes species distinction into account and compares the similarity of sites (similarity indices, slope of the distance decay relationship, length of the ordination axis, and sum of squares of a species matrix). The second group relates species richness (or other summary diversity measures) of two (or more) different scales to each other (additive and multiplicative partitioning). Due to that important distinction, we suggest that beta diversity should be split into two levels, ``differentiation diversity'' (first group) and ``proportional diversity'' (second group). Thus, we propose to use the terms ``inventory diversity'' for within-sample diversity, ``differentiation diversity'' for compositional similarity between samples, and ``proportional diversity'' for the comparison of inventory diversity across spatial and temporal scales.},

However, it is not yet fully understood how climate interacts with human impacts or whether the effects of these factors differ between native and alien species. Facing ongoing climate change and urbanization, we explore the effects of climate on plant species richness and composition across European cities. Location Sixty cities in Western, Central and Southern Europe. Taxon Vascular plants. Methods Species presence was recorded in seven habitats in each city. Large-scale climatic gradients were derived from 22 climatic variables using a partial principal component analysis that controlled for the effects of human population size and gross domestic product. The effects of climate and habitat type on the numbers of native and alien species were tested using linear mixed-effect models. The native and alien compositional variation across cities and habitats was analysed using principal component analysis with variation partitioning. Results The Mediterranean-to-temperate climatic gradient had a significant effect on species numbers across all habitats. The numbers of both native and alien species increased from the Mediterranean to temperate Europe. Within each city, the proportion of alien species decreased from highly urbanized to less urbanized habitats. Climate had a stronger effect on the composition of alien plants than on the composition of native plants. The native species composition especially changed from the Mediterranean to temperate cities and alien species composition also from oceanic to continental cities. Main conclusions Urban native and alien species richness follow the pattern found for the whole European flora. Based on this observation, we suggest that the future shift of warm and dry conditions from the Mediterranean to the north that is expected under global change scenarios could affect richness and change the composition of European urban floras. However, this shift would not necessarily alter the proportions of aliens.},

The theory of errors provides, through the scale invariant exponential dispersion models, a number of statistical distributions that are characterized by Taylor's law. One of these models, the scale invariant Poisson gamma (PG) distribution, has its power function exponent constrained to range between 1 and 2, as observed with many ecological systems. The PG model can be interpreted such that each quadrat would contain a random (Poisson-distributed) number of clusters that, on average, would themselves contain gamma-distributed number of individuals presumably determined by stochastic birth, death and immigration processes. Scale invariant exponential dispersion models also serve as limiting distributions for a wide range of other general linearized models, a property which could explain the manifestation of the variance to mean power function in so many diverse and complex natural processes and simulations.},

The majority of open access articles are published in a minority of journals that levy article processing charges (APCs) paid by authors or their institutions upon acceptance. Increases in APCs is proceeding at a rate three times that which would be expected if APCs were indexed according to inflation. As increasingly ambitious funder mandates are proposed, such as Plan S, it is important to evaluate whether authors show signs of price sensitivity in journal selection by avoiding journals that introduce or increase their APCs. Examining journals that introduced an APC 4-5 years after launch or when flipping from a subscription model to immediate open access model showed no evidence that APC introduction reduced article volumes. Multilevel modelling of APC sensitivity across 319 journals published by the four largest APC-funded dedicated commercial open access publishers (BMC, Frontiers, MDPI, and Hindawi) revealed that from 2012 to 2018 higher APCs were actually associated with increased article volumes. These findings indicate that APC hyperinflation is not suppressed through market competition and author choice. Instead, demand for scholarly journal publications may be more similar to demand for necessities, or even prestige goods, which will support APC hyperinflation to the detriment of researchers, institutions, and funders.},

The family of generalised linear latent variable models in particular has proven popular for building JSDMs, being able to handle many response types including presence-absence data, biomass, overdispersed and/or zero-inflated counts. We extend latent variable models to handle percent cover response variables, with vegetation, sessile invertebrate and macroalgal cover data representing the prime examples of such data arising in community ecology. Sparsity is a commonly encountered challenge with percent cover data. Responses are typically recorded as percentages covered per plot, though some species may be completely absent or present, that is, have 0\% or 100\% cover, respectively, rendering the use of beta distribution inadequate. We propose two JSDMs suitable for percent cover data, namely a hurdle beta model and an ordered beta model. We compare the two proposed approaches to a beta distribution for shifted responses, transformed presence-absence data and an ordinal model for percent cover classes. Results demonstrate the hurdle beta JSDM was generally the most accurate at retrieving the latent variables and predicting ecological percent cover data.},

To assess their current status, 284 relev{\'e}s, representing tugai plant communities in the lower reaches of the Amu Dar'ya, have been analyzed. For each one, the position on ecological gradients was determined by species indicator values. It is shown that the scatter of relev{\'e}s is the greatest for moisture gradient: from 17 to 97 grades, and it is noticeably smaller for pasture digression (2.5--6.5) and soil salinity (16.1--19.5). To reveal the relationships between the species composition and environmental factors, CCA ordination was performed. Groups of relev{\'e}s, representing the native tugai vegetation and three ecological series connected with salinity, soil moisture, and anthropogenic pressure, are identified. According to them, four generalized plant communities, differing in species composition, floristic diversity, and structure, are distinguished. Indicator plants are identified on the basis of a formalized assessment of species constancy and importance values. The changes in species composition and structure of communities (life form spectra) are shown. It has been established that vegetation halophytization is the most active process following progressive desertification. This process is reflected in the replacement of poplar forests by shrub communities dominated by Halostachys belangeriana and Tamarix hispida. As a result of intensive anthropogenic impact, the vegetation is transformed and the importance value of ruderal annual plants becomes higher.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to investigate how predatory journals are characterized by authors who write about such journals. We emphasize the ways in which predatory journals have been conflated with---or distinguished from---open access journals. We created a list of relevant publications on predatory publishing using four databases: Web of Science, Scopus, Dimensions, and Microsoft Academic. We included 280 English-language publications in the review according to their contributions to the discussions on predatory publishing. Then, we coded and qualitatively analyzed these publications. The findings show the profound influence of Jeffrey Beall, who composed and maintained himself lists of predatory publishers and journals, on the whole discussion on predatory publishing. The major themes by which Beall has characterized predatory journals are widely present in non-Beall publications. Moreover, 122 papers we reviewed combined predatory publishing with open access using similar strategies as Beall. The overgeneralization of the flaws of some open access journals to the entire open access movement has led to unjustified prejudices among the academic community toward open access. This is the first large-scale study that systematically examines how predatory publishing is defined in the literature.},

Cyclones can drastically alter estuarine ecosystems, affecting ecosystem function and service delivery. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of an extreme weather event, Cyclone Gabrielle, on estuarine macrobenthic communities and estuarine ecosystem functions in two estuaries in New Zealand. The data was analysed from prior to the passage of the cyclone (Before), soon after its passage (Event), and in the year after its passage (After), focusing on intertidal soft-sediment macroinvertebrate communities and metrics (e.g., abundance, richness, diversity, functional traits, functional richness, functional redundancy) and the overall relationship between macrobenthic fauna, their functional traits, and environmental conditions (i.e., estuarine ecosystem functioning). Results showed that the extreme weather event caused significant changes in macrobenthic metrics over time. Decreases in key macrobenthic metrics were coincident with the Event and After the cyclone in one of the estuaries. Results also showed changes in estuarine ecosystem functioning as macrobenthic metrics and functional traits changed, with reduced and weaker relationships found After the cyclone, suggesting potential disruption of key processes, functions, and services that estuarine ecosystems provide. Yet, these findings provide evidence of relatively rapid and nearly complete recovery to pre-cyclone ecological conditions within a year of the extreme weather event. More frequent extreme weather events might surpass the recovery periods of macrobenthic organisms and the environment, leading to greater impacts.},

  abstract = {Invasions of alien plants pose a serious threat to native biodiversity and ecosystem processes. Forests are considered more resistant to invasion due to limited light availability in understories. However, disturbance and abiotic stress may open tree canopies and promote invasion. Their combined effects together with the resistance of resident species may determine the numbers and abundances of invasive species. Here we explore how canopy openness, water stress, and taxonomic and functional properties of resident communities affect the invasion by a frequent single invasive species (Aster lanceolatus and Impatiens parviflora) compared to that by multiple invaders in Central European lowland forests. Different abiotic factors and species-specific mechanisms of invasiveness determined the success of single versus multiple invaders. The massive spread of A. lanceolatus was associated with the long-distance seed dispersal and exploitation of available resources by fast growth resulting in formations of compact clonal patches in disturbed, open-canopy floodplain forests. The success of I. parviflora was caused by avoiding competition via tolerating less favorable conditions under the dense tree canopy on drier sandy soils. A. lanceolatus thus suppressed resident species richness, while I. parviflora spread in communities of higher functional and phylogenetic diversity. Multiple invasive species, mostly represented by subordinate species with low cover, colonized forests that were rich in resident species. We conclude that a combination of intense disturbance and stress favor the invasion of single dominant species that act as drivers of changes in native communities. Multiple invasive species colonize forests with less extreme conditions acting more as passengers who increase rather than decrease forest diversity.},

  abstract = {National Park Service units in the United States play a large role in providing habitat for native pollinators. In parks that are established to preserve cultural landscapes, park managers recognize an opportunity to improve pollinator habitat while maintaining historically accurate conditions. In this study, we document floral resources and native bees within managed park grasslands, with the goal of providing information to managers to help them maximize pollinator habitat while meeting other management objectives. The study was performed on 37 grassland properties in the mid-Atlantic region of the eastern United States, distributed across four parks; each property was managed with one of three management types: cool-season hayed, cool-season pasture, or warm-season meadows managed with multiple approaches. We surveyed bees and open flowers on 50-m transects twice each year in 2021 and 2022. Repeated-measures ANOVA models revealed that mean bee abundance, richness, evenness, and diversity did not vary among sites or management types. This finding was further supported by a principal coordinates analysis that showed that bee community composition was similar across management types. Nonetheless, we found evidence to indicate that the three management types did not produce equivalent habitat for bees. Species accumulation curves showed that the effective number of flower species was consistently lower in cool-season pastures, relative to the other two management types. Furthermore, we detected positive correlations between bee and flower diversity metrics in one of the 2 years, indicating that floral metrics are associated with bee communities, at least under certain conditions. Collectively, our study suggests that cool-season fields that are hayed and warm-season meadows have higher floral diversity than cool-season pastures within national park units of the mid-Atlantic region, and this higher diversity of forbs has the potential to benefit native bee diversity.},

  abstract = {Plants are multifaceted organisms that have evolved numerous solutions to the problem of establishing, growing and reproducing with limited resources. The intrinsic dimensionality of plant traits is the minimum number of independent axes of variation that adequately describes the functional variation among plants and is therefore a fundamental quantity in comparative plant ecology. Given the large number of functional traits that are measured on plants, the dimensionality of plant form and function is potentially vast. A variety of linear and nonlinear methods were used to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of three large trait data sets. The results of these analyses indicate that while the dimensionality of plant traits is generally larger than we have admitted in the past, it does not exceed six in the most comprehensive data set. The dimensionality of plant form and function is a blessing, not a curse. The higher the intrinsic dimension of traits in an analysis, the more easily our models will be able to accurately discriminate species in trait space and therefore be able to predict species distributions and abundances. Recent analyses indicate that the ability to predict community composition increases rapidly with additional traits, but reaches a plateau after four to eight traits. Synthesis. There appears to be a tractable upper limit to the dimensionality of plant traits. To optimize research efficiency for advancing our understanding of trait-based community assembly, ecologists should minimize the number of traits while maximizing the number of dimensions, because including multiple correlated traits does not yield dividends and including more than eight traits leads to diminishing returns. It is recommended to measure traits from multiple organs whenever possible, especially leaf, stem, root and flowering traits, given their consistent performance in explaining community assembly across different ecosystems.},

  abstract = {There are many examples in the literature of a positive correlation between the distribution of a species and its local abundance, i.e., widely occurring species tend to be more abundant locally when they do occur. Such relations have been documented over a wide range of taxa and spatial scales. There are five major hypotheses seeking to explain the relation: Random placement, Sampling error, Niche width, Demography, and Metapopulation dynamics. However, there is little evidence to distinguish between them, especially for plants. In this study, plant species presence in a short tussock grassland in inland Canterbury, New Zealand was sampled at three spatial scales (i.e. quadrat sizes; sizes of spatial grain): 0.2x0.3 m, 0.4x0.6 m, and 1.0x1.5 m, each divided into 0.1x0.15 m sub-quadrats for recording local frequency. The data were also analysed at different ranges of soil pH, water content, organic content and fertility (by bioassay). Significant positive correlations between species distribution and local abundance were found at the two larger spatial grain scales. There was no significant relation for native species, but the relation for exotic species was considerably stronger than that over all species. Reduction of environmental heterogeneity, by restricting the dataset to narrower ranges of soil factors, produced higher correlations at the two smaller grain scales. In contrast to reports in the literature, many species (most of them native) showed narrow regional distributions but high local abundance when they were at a site. It is concluded that the Sampling-error hypothesis cannot be an explanation of the results obtained here. Aspects of the results are inconsistent with the Random-placement, Demography and Niche-width hypotheses. The results are most compatible with the Metapopulation dynamics hypothesis. However, it is likely that several mechanisms are operating simultaneously. Whilst detailed analysis of empirical distributions at different spatial grains and over different ecological ranges can exclude some of the hypotheses, detailed studies of the autecology of species are the next necessary step.},

Tests of significance of the individual canonical axes in redundancy analysis allow researchers to determine which of the axes represent variation that can be distinguished from random. Variation along the significant axes can be mapped, used to draw biplots or interpreted through subsequent analyses, whilst the nonsignificant axes may be dropped from further consideration. 2. Three methods have been implemented in computer programs to test the significance of the canonical axes; they are compared in this paper. The simultaneous test of all individual canonical axes, which is appealing because of its simplicity, produced incorrect (highly inflated) levels of type I error for the axes following those corresponding to true relationships in the data, so it is invalid. The `marginal' testing method implemented in the `vegan' R package and the `forward' testing method implemented in the program CANOCO were found to have correct levels of type I error and comparable power. Permutation of the residuals achieved greater power than permutation of the raw data. 3. R functions found in a Supplement to this paper provide the first formal description of the `marginal' and `forward' testing methods.},

However, this view neglects the fact that different species and sites in the landscape can vary widely in how they contribute to these metacommunity-wide attributes. We argue for a new conceptual framework with matched analytics with the goals of studying the complex and interactive relations between process and pattern in metacommunities that is focused on the variation among species and among sites which we call the `internal structure' of the metacommunity. To demonstrate how the internal structure could be studied, we create synthetic data using a process-based colonization--extinction metacommunity model. We then use joint species distribution models to estimate how the contributions of space, environment, and biotic interactions driving metacommunity assembly differ among species and sites. We find that this approach to the internal structure of metacommunities provides useful information about the distinct ways that different species and different sites contribute to metacommunity structure. Although it has limitations, our work points at a more general approach to understand how other possible complexities might affect internal structure and might thus be incorporated into a more cohesive metacommunity theory.},

We first investigate issues related to its definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

  abstract = {Traditionally managed grasslands are among the most species-rich communities, which are threatened by land use changes---management intensification or abandonment. The resistance of their species composition to mismanagement and ability to recover after re-establishment of traditional management is of prime conservational interest. In a manipulative experiment in a wet meadow, we simulated mismanagement by a factorial combination of abandonment of mowing and fertilization. The dominant species Molinia caerulea was removed in half of the plots to assess its role in community dynamics. The 21 years' mismanagement period was followed by the re-establishment of the traditional management. The plots were sampled yearly from 1994 (the baseline data, before the introduction of the experimental treatments), until 2023. Estimates of cover of all vascular plant species provided the species richness and effective number of species. For each year, the chord distances to baseline species composition and to corresponding control plot were calculated. The compositional data were analyzed by constrained ordination methods, and the univariate characteristics by Repeated Measures ANOVA. All the plots, including those with traditional management throughout the whole experiment, underwent directional changes, probably caused by a decrease in groundwater level due to global warming. Both fertilization and abandonment led to a loss of competitively weak, usually low-statured species, due to increased asymmetric competition for light. The effect of fertilization was faster and stronger than that of abandonment demonstrating weaker resistance to fertilization. The removal of dominant species partially mitigated negative effects only in unmown, non-fertilized plots. The recovery following mismanagement cessation was faster (signifying higher resilience) in unmown than in fertilized plots, where it was slowed by a legacy of fertilization. In a changing world, two reference plot types are recommended for assessment of resistance and resilience, one original state and one reflecting compositional changes independent of treatments.},

  abstract = {Northeastern U.S. farms are often situated adjacent to forestland due to the heterogeneous nature of the landscape. We investigated how forested areas influence Carabidae diversity within nearby crop fields by establishing transects of pitfall traps. Trapping extended across a forest-agriculture ecotone consisting of maize, an intermediate mowed grass margin, and a forest edge. Carabidae diversity was compared among the three habitats, and community and population dynamics were assessed along the transect. We used a principal response curve to examine and visualize community change across a spatial gradient. The highest levels of richness and evenness were observed in the forest community, and carabid assemblages shifted significantly across the ecotone, especially at the forest-grass interface. Despite strong ecotone effects, population distributions showed that some species were found in all three habitats and seemed to thrive at the ecotone. Based on similarity indices, carabid assemblages collected in maize adjacent to forest differed from carabid assemblages in maize not adjacent to forest. We conclude that forest carabid assemblages exhibit high degrees of dissimilarity with those found in agricultural fields and forested areas should thus be retained in agricultural landscapes to increase biodiversity at the landscape scale. However, ecotone species found at forest edges can still noticeably influence carabid community composition within neighboring agricultural fields. Further studies should determine how these shifts in carabid assemblages influence agroecosystem services in relation to ecosystem services observed in fields embedded in an agricultural matrix.},

Soil microbiota are fundamentally linked to the restoration of degraded ecosystems, helping to underpin ecological functions and plant communities. High-throughput sequencing of soil eDNA to characterise these communities offers promise to help monitor and predict ecological progress towards reference states. Here we demonstrate a novel methodology for monitoring and evaluating ecological restoration using three long-term ({$>$}25 year) case study post-mining rehabilitation soil eDNA-based bacterial community datasets. Specifically, we developed rehabilitation trajectory assessments based on similarity to reference data from restoration chronosequence datasets. Recognising that numerous alternative options for microbiota data processing have potential to influence these assessments, we comprehensively examined the influence of standard versus compositional data analyses, different ecological distance measures, sequence grouping approaches, eliminating rare taxa, and the potential for excessive spatial autocorrelation to impact on results. Our approach reduces the complexity of information that often overwhelms ecologically-relevant patterns in microbiota studies, and enables prediction of recovery time, with explicit inclusion of uncertainty in assessments. We offer a step change in the development of quantitative microbiota-based SMART metrics for measuring rehabilitation success. Our approach may also have wider applications where restorative processes facilitate the shift of microbiota towards reference states.},

Pomacea canaliculata is one of the world's 100 worst invasive alien species. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to analyze the seasonal variation of gut microbiota of P. canaliculata. The results suggested that the predominant gut microbial phyla of P. canaliculata included Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, which helped digest plant food and accumulate energy. The gut microbiota of P. canaliculata in summer group showed the highest diversity, whereas the winter group possessed the lowest, probably due to the shortage of food resources of P. canaliculata in winter. Principal coordinate analysis analysis based on unweighted unifrac and weighted unifrac indicated that the composition of gut microbiota of P. canaliculata significantly varied across seasons. Bacteroidetes tended to be enriched in summer by linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis. Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria were extremely abundant in autumn, while Fusobacteria and Cetobacterium enriched in winter. In conclusion, the structure of the gut microbiota of P. canaliculata was significantly different among seasons, which was beneficial to the environment adaptation and the digestion and metabolism of food during different periods.},

We highlight key developments under the three pillars that have increased the rate of restoration by the Columbia Estuary Ecosystem Restoration Program (CEERP) over 20 years: science, coordination, and management. We show how such programs can be institutionalized to ensure that estuary ecosystems are better understood, conserved, and restored. The principal conservation effort under CEERP is to reconnect historical floodplain wetlands to the mainstem. The program also supports other restoration actions that demonstrate a high potential to benefit ecosystem function and endangered salmon populations; however, there is greater uncertainty regarding these less-utilized techniques. Through adaptive management, we address technical uncertainty regarding benefits to the environmental resource and programmatic uncertainty pertaining to decision-making. Here, we examine three periods of CEERP growth to establish how complementary research and restoration actions have improved program outcomes over time. We highlight the tools and processes that were developed and integrated into the program to refine program strategy, improve project design, and maximize ecological benefits. CEERP supported 77 restoration projects and reconnected over 7,000 acres of floodplain habitat to the lower Columbia River between 2004 and 2021. Building on these successes, we outline current plans to better engage landowners and local communities, solicit new project types, and maintain enough flexibility within the program to adapt to new priorities.},

  abstract = {Seed dispersal is a key process that influences the recruitment of plant species, yielding profound consequences on vegetation structure. This process can be affected by environmental disturbances, such as fires, leading to varied impacts on the agents involved, both dispersers and plants. We investigated the potential role of small mammals (rodents and marsupials) as seed dispersers in a Neotropical savanna (Brazilian Cerrado). We also evaluated the impact of fire severity on the seed dispersal services provided by these animals in gallery forests, 3 years after a major fire event. We live-trapped small mammals in 14 sites, 7 of which were located in forests classified in three categories of fire severity (``unburned'', ``low severity'', or ``moderate severity''). We captured 13 mammal species, finding a total of 11,688 seeds in their feces (collected inside traps or handling bags). These seeds encompassed 28 plant species from at least 8 families. A multivariate analysis (NMDS) revealed differences among small mammal species in terms of potentially dispersed plants, with seeds of 18 plant species being consumed by no more than one small mammal species. An increase in fire severity affected the composition of plant species potentially dispersed, changed the relative role of forest small mammals as seed dispersers, and decreased observed richness of defecated seeds. We conclude that high-severity wildfires affect highly relevant ecological processes, such as seed dispersal by animals. These effects could impact the recruitment dynamics of plant species and, consequently, the vegetation recovery and plant community composition in fire-affected areas.

  abstract = {The importance of the scale of observation in vegetation science has long been recognized. We have evaluated the effect of grain (plot dimension) on the detection of changes induced by shrubs cutting on plant composition of a calcareous grassland in Southern Tuscany (Italy). We conducted a 2-year before 2-year after-control-impact (BACI) field sampling design. We collected the cover of vascular plants using nested square quadrats with 0.5, 1 and 2m sides. Any deviation of the restored plots from the control was analyzed by using the principal response curve (PRC) technique. Differences between the control and the restored plots, in time, accounted for 4.5, 3.3 and 7.4 of the between-plot variation in species composition, respectively for 0.25, 1 and 4m(2) plots, but only the first PRC component of the largest scale was statistically significant. The results showed that the ability to differentiate the control from the restored plots, changed with increasing grain size although we did not obtain a monotonic behavior of the variance explained by the multivariate model. Including the assessment of scale dependence in the monitoring project appears useful and necessary to correctly evaluate the effects of restoration actions in a consistent way.},

Standard approaches to this issue use co-occurrence indices such as Jaccard, S{\o}rensen-Dice, and Simpson.

We propose an index, {$\alpha$}, that is insensitive to prevalences. Published datasets reanalyzed with both {$\alpha$} and Jaccard's index (J) yield profoundly different biological inferences. For example, a published analysis using J contradicted predictions of the island biogeography theory finding that community stability increased with increasing physical isolation. Reanalysis of the same dataset with the estimator {$\mathbf{\alpha}\alpha$}{\textasciicircum} reversed that result and supported theoretical predictions. We found similarly marked effects in reanalyses of antibiotic cross-resistance and human disease biomarkers.

  abstract = {1. Analysis of co-occurrence data with traditional indices has led to many problems such as sensitivity of the indices to prevalence and the same value representing either a strong positive or strong negative association across different datasets. In our recent study (Mainali et al 2022), we revealed the source of the problems that make the traditional indices fundamentally flawed and unreliable--namely that the indices in common use have no target of estimation quantifying degree of association in the non-null case--and we further developed a novel parameter of association, alpha, with complete formulation of the null distribution for estimating the mechanism of affinity. We also developed the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of alpha in our previous study. 2. Here, we introduce the CooccurrenceAffinity R package that computes the MLE for alpha. We provide functions to perform the analysis based on a 2{\texttimes}2 contingency table of occurrence/co-occurrence counts as well as a m{\texttimes}n presence-absence matrix (e.g., species by site matrix). The flexibility of the function allows a user to compute the alpha MLE for entity pairs on matrix columns based on presence-absence states recorded in the matrix rows, or for entity pairs on matrix rows based on presence-absence recorded in columns. We also provide functions for plotting the computed indices. 3. As novel components of this software paper not reported in the original study, we present theoretical discussion of a median interval and of four types of confidence intervals. We further develop functions (a) to compute those intervals, (b) to evaluate their true coverage probability of enclosing the population parameter, and (c) to generate figures. 4. CooccurrenceAffinity is a practical and efficient R package with user-friendly functions for end-to-end analysis and plotting of co-occurrence data in various formats, making it possible to compute the recently developed metric of alpha MLE as well as its median and confidence intervals introduced in this paper. The package supplements its main output of the novel metric of association with the three most common traditional indices of association in co-occurrence data: Jaccard, S{\o}rensen--Dice, and Simpson.},

A power analysis procedure would need to address three challenges: designing a parsimonious simulation model that captures key community data properties; measuring effect size in a realistic yet interpretable fashion; and ensuring computational feasibility when simulation is used both for power estimation and significance testing. Here, we propose a power analysis procedure that addresses these three challenges by: using for simulation a Gaussian copula model with factor analytical structure, fitted to pilot data; assuming a common effect size across all taxa, but applied in different directions according to expert opinion (to ``increaser'', ``decreaser'' or ``no effect'' taxa); using a critical value approach to estimate power, which reduces computation time by a factor of 500 (if we would otherwise use 999 resamples to estimate each p-value) with minor loss of accuracy. The procedure is demonstrated on pilot data from fish assemblages in a restoration study, where it was found that the planned study design would only be capable of detecting relatively large effects (change in abundance by a factor of 1.7 or more). The methods outlined in this paper are available in accompanying R software (the ecopower package), which allows researchers with pilot data to answer a wide range of design questions to assist them in planning their studies.},

  abstract = {Intensive agricultural land use negatively impacts biodiversity, including arthropod predator diversity and their pest control potential. Alley-cropping agroforestry systems (integration of tree rows into arable land) are increasingly considered an economically viable alternative for more sustainable and biodiversity-friendly agriculture. However, their effectiveness in promoting generalist predator diversity and pest control, especially as a function of space (distance from tree rows) and time (across the growing season) remains poorly understood. We assessed how spider abundance, taxonomic and functional diversity (as proxies of pest control potential) respond to temperate alley-cropping agroforestry systems as compared to open croplands. Additionally, we analysed whether spiders with different habitat preferences (eurytopic, forest and open-habitat specialists) show distinct responses. Lastly, we analysed whether the influence of agroforestry changes with decreasing tree proximity and across the growing season. Tree row proximity generally benefited the abundance, as well as taxonomic and functional diversity of the overall spider communities. Alley-cropping promoted the abundance and taxonomic diversity of forest specialists and eurytopic spiders, without negatively affecting open-habitat specialists. The positive effect of alley cropping was strongest within tree rows and their immediate vicinity, but was still detectable at considerably farther distances. These patterns were temporally dynamic with spider abundance and taxonomic diversity being highest within tree rows in early spring and spiders spilling over to adjacent crop rows in subsequent periods. Synthesis and applications: Overall, our findings highlight that the inclusion of tree rows benefited spiders across the entirety of the 48 m crop rows, independent of crop type. Since the peak in spider abundance and taxonomic diversity in crop rows coincided with crop pest arrival, alley-cropping agroforestry is expected to benefit agricultural production through increased pest control potential. Alley-cropping agroforestry may therefore be an important management strategy to develop more sustainable agricultural systems benefiting farmers and biodiversity alike.},

The aim of this study is to assess the potential sensitivity of springtail assemblages to climate change by presenting some of the first data on the elevation stratification of springtail assemblages in subtropical rainforest. A standardised sampling protocol was used to compare the assemblages of families and species of springtails living within leaf-litter at three elevations in continuous rainforest in south-east Queensland, Australia. Leaf-litter was collected and springtails extracted from four replicate plots at approximately 700, 900 and 1100 m a.s.l. on two sampling occasions (January 2008 and December 2008). Environment variables (elevation of plots, tree species richness, composition and basal area, soil temperature and moisture and a range of physical and chemical properties of the soil) that may correlate with springtail distributions were incorporated into the analyses. Springtail assemblages showed clear elevation patterns, despite some differences between the two sampling occasions. Springtail assemblages characteristic of different elevations particularly when examined at a finer taxonomic resolution (species compared with family-level identification) were identified. Plot elevation (m a.s.l.) correlated most strongly with patterns in springtail species assemblages, but was also highly correlated with several other environmental factors. The results indicate that springtails, as a group, respond strongly to the physico-chemical and/or biological changes that occur with increasing elevation, even over a relatively small elevation range, demonstrating that they have potential as monitoring targets as forests experience climate change.},

A second, briefer period of favorable conditions coincided with the Empire's recovery in the fourth century; regional differences in climate conditions parallel the diverging fates of the eastern and western Empires in subsequent centuries.

Methods We collected data on vascular plant species, vegetation cover and height, soil grain size and organic matter content, and compared the species composition, richness, and diversity of the restored sites with reference plots in the adjacent target vegetation (mature forest). Results Our results show a significantly higher richness and diversity in restored plots compared to reference plots, and an increased similarity of species composition over time. Species composition was most similar to reference plots in naturally revegetated plots and seeding seemed to reduce both species and functional trait composition similarity. Conclusions It is unrealistic that the defined target vegetation will develop on restored sites. Defining a realistic and achievable target vegetation for each road construction project in relation to land use, adjacent vegetation type and successional stage, as e.g., forest edge instead of forest, would be useful. While this may require more effort for management it will translate to higher mitigation success.},

  abstract = {Evaluating mitigation measures to reduce negative impacts of infrastructure construction on vegetation and wildlife    The human footprint is large and growing worldwide. Land-use related to technical infrastructure development, such as road construction or power grid systems, leads to degradation of natural habitat and contributes to 23\% of anthropogenic GHG emissions globally. Combined, this causes major declines in biodiversity and, in extension, ecosystem function. Nevertheless, human mobility will further increase and so will technical infrastructure development. In both road construction and power grid system projects large areas are influenced by construction work and accordingly, large areas of habitat are fragmentated and lost. An approach to combat biodiversity loss due to infrastructure development, is to apply the principles and ideas of ecological restoration within the planning and implementation of mitigation measures. There is a general lack of assessment on the effectiveness of mitigation measures in the construction sector, internationally and in Norway. In order to truly minimise impacts on and restore and protect biodiversity, it is therefore of highest importance to thoroughly assess and evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures.    The aims of this thesis are threefold; to give an impression of the negative impacts of large infrastructure projects on biodiversity in Norway, to study the mitigation measures conducted to reduce these negative impacts and to evaluate the effectiveness of the mitigation measures. This was addressed by using forest inventory data to investigate impacts of distance to roads and houses on moose browsing, and a possible cascading effect on tree recruitment. Further, landscape fragmentation and its mitigation for moose and deer, in form of effective use and placement of wildlife crossing structures, was investigated by the use of a novel method (Equivalent Connected Habitat). Lastly, the effectiveness of revegetation measures in large infrastructure constructions was evaluated with vegetation analysis, comparing different revegetation treatments and levels of survey detail.    Jointly considering the results show, that there is a high pressure from large infrastructure on ecosystems and biodiversity in Norway. Long-term landscape scale planning is important, for the effectiveness of both wildlife crossing structures and revegetation measures. Wildlife crossing structures might have little mitigation effect, if the landscape around is degraded. Time is most important for a successful vegetation recovery, while choice of revegetation treatment is of lesser importance. However, when considering species composition, natural recovery (with or without added topsoil) will in most situations give better or equally good results in terms of vegetation development. It is further necessary to have rather detailed vegetation data to evaluate revegetation measures. This thesis demonstrates the lack of    successful monitoring of mitigation measures. To truly protect and restore biodiversity we need to know the outcome of mitigation measures an hence, a well-planned, thought-through, repeatable and targeted monitoring of mitigation measures is needed, preferably over a longer time period. Where possible, i.e. in projects with a pre-construction period, a BACI (Before-after-control-impact) approach is recommended.},

However, the causes of superposed century-scale cold summer anomalies, of which the Little Ice Age (LIA) is the most extreme, remain debated, largely because the natural forcings are either weak or, in the case of volcanism, short lived. Here we present precisely dated records of ice-cap growth from Arctic Canada and Iceland showing that LIA summer cold and ice growth began abruptly between 1275 and 1300 AD, followed by a substantial intensification 1430?1455 AD. Intervals of sudden ice growth coincide with two of the most volcanically perturbed half centuries of the past millennium. A transient climate model simulation shows that explosive volcanism produces abrupt summer cooling at these times, and that cold summers can be maintained by sea-ice/ocean feedbacks long after volcanic aerosols are removed. Our results suggest that the onset of the LIA can be linked to an unusual 50-year-long episode with four large sulfur-rich explosive eruptions, each with global sulfate loading {$>$}60 Tg. The persistence of cold summers is best explained by consequent sea-ice/ocean feedbacks during a hemispheric summer insolation minimum; large changes in solar irradiance are not required.},

However, applications of quantitative models have been uneven across fields, and many biologists lack the foundational training necessary to apply them in their research or to interpret their results to inform biological problem-solving efforts. This gap in scientific training has created a false dichotomy of ``biologists'' and ``modelers'' that only exacerbates the barriers to working biologists seeking additional training in quantitative modeling. Here, we make the argument that all biologists are modelers and are capable of using sophisticated quantitative modeling in their work. We highlight four benefits of conducting biological research within the framework of quantitative models, identify the potential producers and consumers of information produced by such models, and make recommendations for strategies to overcome barriers to their widespread implementation. Improved understanding of quantitative modeling could guide the producers of biological information to better apply biological measurements through analyses that evaluate mechanisms, and allow consumers of biological information to better judge the quality and applications of the information they receive. As our explanations of biological phenomena increase in complexity, so too must we embrace modeling as a foundational skill.},

Both LNMDS and PCoA were applied to a matrix of Bray-Curtis coefficients. The results clearly demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the linear techniques (PCA, PCoA), due to curvilinear distortion. Gaussian ordination proved very sensitive to noise and was not robust to marked departures from a symmetric, unimodal response model. The currently popular method of DCA displayed a lack of robustness to variations in the response model and the sampling pattern. Furthermore, DCA ordinations of two-dimensional models often exhibited marked distortions, even when response surfaces were unimodal and symmetric. LNMDS is recommended as a robust technique for indirect gradient analysis, which deserves more widespread use by community ecologists.},

As a result, the integration of disparate datasets is a rapidly growing area in quantitative ecology, and is subsequently becoming a major asset in understanding the shifts and trends in species' distributions. However, the tools and software available to construct statistical models to integrate these disparate datasets into a unified framework is lacking. This has made these methods inaccessible to general practitioners and has stagnated the growth of data integration in more applied settings. We therefore present PointedSDMs: an easy to use R package used to construct integrated species distribution models. It provides functions to easily format the data, fit the models in a computationally efficient way and presents the output in a format that is convenient for additional work. This paper illustrates the different uses and functions available in the package, which are designed to simplify the modelling of integrated models. A case study using the package is also presented: combining three datasets coming from different sampling protocols, all containing records of Setophaga caerulescens across Pennsylvania state.},

  abstract = {Temperate reefs are increasingly affected by the direct and indirect effects of climate change. At many of their warm range edges, cool-water kelps are decreasing, while seaweeds with warm-water affinities are increasing. These habitat-forming species provide different ecological functions, and shifts to warm-affinity seaweeds are expected to modify the structure of associated communities. Predicting the nature of such shifts at the ecosystem level is, however, challenging, as they often occur gradually over large geographical areas. Here, we take advantage of a climatic transition zone, where cool-affinity (kelp) and warm-affinity (Sargassum) seaweed forests occur adjacently under similar environmental conditions, to test whether these seaweed habitats support different associated seaweed, invertebrate, coral, and fish assemblages. We found clear differences in associated seaweed assemblages between habitats characterized by kelp and Sargassum abundance, with kelp having higher biomass and seaweed diversity and more cool-affinity species than Sargassum habitats. The multivariate invertebrate and fish assemblages were not different between habitats, despite a higher diversity of fish species in the Sargassum habitat. No pattern in temperature affinity of the invertebrate or fish assemblages in each habitat was found, and few fish species were exclusive to one habitat or the other. These findings suggest that, as ocean warming continues to replace kelps with Sargassum, the abundance and diversity of associated seaweeds could decrease, whereas fish could increase. Nevertheless, the more tropicalized seaweed habitats may provide a degree of functional redundancy to associated fauna in temperate seaweed habitats.},

  abstract = {Riparian soils, together with vegetation, play a crucial role in supporting biodiversity and driving biogeochemical processes within river ecosystems. Conservation of riparian soils and artificial planting are essential for river ecosystem recovery following land degradation. Researchers focus on examining soil nutrients, microbial biomass, and organic acid metabolism in the interactions between plants and soil along riverbanks. However, the seasonal responses of riparian soils to artificial plantations have been infrequently reported in the existing literature. This study investigates the influence of seasonal variations on soil conditions and the growth of artificially planted species in the riparian zones of the Three Gorges Dam Reservoir (TGDR) in China. The species sampled include Cynodon dactylon, Hemarthria altissima, and Salix matsudana. These species provide valuable insight into soil properties along riparian zones, assessing interactions across different seasons: T1 (spring), T2 (summer), and T3 (autumn). The results demonstrated significant seasonal changes in soil organic matter, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and other indicators between T1 and T3. Apart from invertase activity in H. altissima soil, enzyme activity peaked during T1. Dominant soil bacteria were examined using high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing, revealing that the available bacteria belong to 62 phyla and 211 classes. Among the most abundant were Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, averaging over 60\,\% across all soil samples. Principal component analyses accounted for 62.81\,\% (T1), 50.57\,\% (T2), and 54.08\,\% (T3) of the variation observed in the study, indicating that soil properties were predominantly influenced by the different seasonal phases, assuming all other factors remained constant. Pearson correlation analysis (p {$<$} 0.05) identified strong positive correlations between physical properties and all three plant species during T1 (r {$\leq$} 0.94), as well as significant negative correlations with bacterial communities in T2 and T3 (r {$\leq$} -1.00). These findings suggest that the selected plant species are well-suited to cultivation in the riparian zone of the TGDR. This study enhances our understanding of seasonal dynamics in riparian environments, offering practical insights into their management.},

  abstract = {In ecological community studies it is often of interest to study the effect of species related trait variables on abundances or presence-absences. Specifically, the interest may lay in the interactions between environmental and trait variables. An increasingly popular approach for studying such interactions is to use the so-called fourth-corner model, which explicitly posits a regression model where the mean response of each species is a function of interactions between covariate and trait predictors (among other terms). On the other hand, many of the fourth-corner models currently applied in the literature are too simplistic to properly account for variation in environmental and trait response and any residual covariation between species. To overcome this problem, we propose a fourth-corner latent variable model which combines the following three features: latent variables to capture the correlation between species, fourth-corner terms to account for environment-trait interactions, and species-specific random slopes for modeling excess heterogeneity between species in their environmental response. We perform an extensive numerical study comparing a variety of fourth-corner models available in the literature which account for the aforementioned sources of variation to varying degrees. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed fourth-corner latent variable models performed well when testing for the fourth-corner (interaction) coefficients, across both Type I error and power. By comparison, some models that do not full account for all relevant sources of variation suffer from inflated Type I error leading to potentially misleading inference. The proposed method is illustrated by an example on ground beetle data.},

The r package gllvm offers relatively fast methods to fit GLLVMs via maximum likelihood, along with tools for model checking, visualization and inference. The main advantage of the package over other implementations is speed, for example, being two orders of magnitude faster, and capable of handling thousands of response variables. These advances come from using variational approximations to simplify the likelihood expression to be maximized, automatic differentiation software for model-fitting (via the TMB package) and careful choice of initial values for parameters. Examples are used to illustrate the main features and functionality of the package, such as constrained or unconstrained ordination, including functional traits in `fourth corner' models, and (if the number of environmental coefficients is not large) make inferences about environmental associations.},

We identified three major phases, planning, implementation, and monitoring, in the restoration process. We found that evaluation occurred both within and between the three phases, that it included both formal and informal components, and that it often had an impact on the performance of the projects. Most evaluations were short-term and only some parts of them were properly documented. Poor or short-term evaluation of the restoration process creates a risk that inefficient methods will continue to be used, which reduces the efficiency and effectiveness of restoration. To improve the restoration process and to transfer the knowledge to future projects, we argue for more formal, sustained evaluation procedures, involving all relevant stakeholders, and increased and improved documentation and dissemination of the results.},

  abstract = {Deforestation threatens the integrity of the Amazon biome and the ecosystem services it provides, including greenhouse gas mitigation. Forest-to-pasture conversion has been shown to alter the flux of methane gas (CH4) in Amazonian soils, driving a switch from acting as a sink to a source of atmospheric CH4. This study aimed to better understand this phenomenon by investigating soil microbial metagenomes, focusing on the taxonomic and functional structure of methane-cycling communities. Metagenomic data from forest and pasture soils were combined with measurements of in situ CH4 fluxes and soil edaphic factors and analysed using multivariate statistical approaches. We found a significantly higher abundance and diversity of methanogens in pasture soils. As inferred by co-occurrence networks, these microorganisms seem to be less interconnected within the soil microbiota in pasture soils. Metabolic traits were also different between land uses, with increased hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic pathways of methanogenesis in pasture soils. Land-use change also induced shifts in taxonomic and functional traits of methanotrophs, with bacteria harbouring genes encoding the soluble form of methane monooxygenase enzyme (sMMO) depleted in pasture soils. Redundancy analysis and multimodel inference revealed that the shift in methane-cycling communities was associated with high pH, organic matter, soil porosity and micronutrients in pasture soils. These results comprehensively characterize the effect of forest-to-pasture conversion on the microbial communities driving the methane-cycling microorganisms in the Amazon rainforest, which will contribute to the efforts to preserve this important biome.},

Apart from the fact that generalized linear models are better suited in dealing with count data, a log-transformation of counts has the additional quandary in how to deal with zero observations. With just one zero observation (if this observation represents a sampling unit), the whole data set needs to be fudged by adding a value (usually 1) before transformation. 3. Simulating data from a negative binomial distribution, we compared the outcome of fitting models that were transformed in various ways (log, square root) with results from fitting models using quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models to untransformed count data. 4. We found that the transformations performed poorly, except when the dispersion was small and the mean counts were large. The quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models consistently performed well, with little bias. 5. We recommend that count data should not be analysed by log-transforming it, but instead models based on Poisson and negative binomial distributions should be used.},

  abstract = {Aim The objective of this research was to analyze the association between evaluated level of species disturbance between sites as well as determine the abundance and diversity of invasive alien species and the physicochemical parameters of soil samples with the view to determining the impact of mining on the distribution of invasive species. Method Four Land use types: active mining, abandoned mining, farmland and relatively undisturbed forest were selected as sampling sites for the study. Two 20~m by 20~m sampling plots were randomly selected in each land use types. Plants were identified to assess the floristic composition, the level of colonization of invasive species, and the diversity of the plant species. Soil chemical and physical properties in sites were analysed and plant-soil relationship was determined by means of Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Result Diversity analysis showed that the active mining site was the least diverse and abandoned mining site the most diverse. The characteristics of the populations of the invasive plant species in the mining sites were weeds (10\%), shrubs (60\%), and climbers (30\%). Distribution of invasive species was influenced by the four land use types (active mining, abandoned mining, farming and relatively undisturbed forest). Solanum torvum, Panicum brevifolium, Centrosema pubescens, Commelina erecta were found to be associated with active mining site. Abandoned mining and farming sites had similar composition of invasive species. Soil analysis showed significant difference between total nitrogen, available phosphorus, organic carbon and CEC between undisturbed forest and the active mining sites. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that active mining site was associated with increasing acidity, Na+ and bulk density and characterised by plant species such as Solanum torvum, Panicum brevifolium, Centrosema pubescens, Commelina erecta while undisturbed site was associated with increasing available P, Ca2+, total N, Organic C, CEC and Mg2+ and characterised by species such as Cola hispida, Lecaniodiscus cupanoides, Bahia nitida, Mirodesmis puberula, Monodora tenuifolia. Principal component analysis identified Organic C, Total N and Ca2+ as the most important physico-chemical factors responsible for variations observed in the study. Conclusion The study concluded that land use has significant effect on soil and is a driver for low plant diversity and introduction of invasive plant species.},

To facilitate the integration between conceptual and statistical approaches in community ecology, we propose Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) as a general, flexible framework for modern analysis of community data. While non-manipulative data allow for only correlative and not causal inference, this framework facilitates the formulation of data-driven hypotheses regarding the processes that structure communities. We model environmental filtering by variation and covariation in the responses of individual species to the characteristics of their environment, with potential contingencies on species traits and phylogenetic relationships. We capture biotic assembly rules by species-to-species association matrices, which may be estimated at multiple spatial or temporal scales. We operationalise the HMSC framework as a hierarchical Bayesian joint species distribution model, and implement it as R- and Matlab-packages which enable computationally efficient analyses of large data sets. Armed with this tool, community ecologists can make sense of many types of data, including spatially explicit data and time-series data. We illustrate the use of this framework through a series of diverse ecological examples.},

  abstract = {A key challenge for community ecology is to understand to what extent observational data can be used to infer the underlying community assembly processes. As different processes can lead to similar or even identical patterns, statistical analyses of non-manipulative observational data never yield undisputable causal inference on the underlying processes. Still, most empirical studies in community ecology are based on observational data, and hence understanding under which circumstances such data can shed light on assembly processes is a central concern for community ecologists. We simulated a spatial agent-based model that generates variation in metacommunity dynamics across multiple axes, including the four classic metacommunity paradigms as special cases. We further simulated a virtual ecologist who analysed snapshot data sampled from the simulations using eighteen output metrics derived from beta-diversity and habitat variation indices, variation partitioning and joint species distribution modelling. Our results indicated two main axes of variation in the output metrics. The first axis of variation described whether the landscape has patchy or continuous variation, and thus was essentially independent of the properties of the species community. The second axis of variation related to the level of predictability of the metacommunity. The most predictable communities were niche-based metacommunities inhabiting static landscapes with marked environmental heterogeneity, such as metacommunities following the species sorting paradigm or the mass effects paradigm. The most unpredictable communities were neutral-based metacommunities inhabiting dynamics landscapes with little spatial heterogeneity, such as metacommunities following the neutral or patch sorting paradigms. The output metrics from joint species distribution modelling yielded generally the highest resolution to disentangle among the simulated scenarios. Yet, the different types of statistical approaches utilized in this study carried complementary information, and thus our results suggest that the most comprehensive evaluation of metacommunity structure can be obtained by combining them.},

To test whether CCA suffers from the same defects, I simulated data sets with properties that usually cause problems for DCA. Results indicate that CCA performs quite well with skewed species distributions, with quantitative noise in species abundance data, with samples taken from unusual sampling designs, with highly intercorrelated environmental variables, and with situations where not all of the factors determining species composition are known.

In this meticulously researched volume, master historian Geoffrey Parker presents the firsthand testimony of men and women who saw and suffered from the sequence of political, economic, and social crises between 1618 to the late 1680s. Parker also deploys the scientific evidence of climate change during this period. His discoveries revise entirely our understanding of the General Crisis: changes in prevailing weather patterns, especially longer winters and cooler and wetter summers, disrupted growing seasons and destroyed harvests. This in turn brought hunger, malnutrition, and disease; and as material conditions worsened, wars, rebellions, and revolutions rocked the world.  Parker's demonstration of the link between climate change, war, and catastrophe 350 years ago stands as an extraordinary historical achievement. And the implications of his study are equally important: are we adequately prepared-or even preparing-for the catastrophes that climate change brings?},

  abstract = {Plantation forests constitute a significant amount of the wooded area in many parts of the globe. However, the extent of biological provision conferred by plantation forest depends on regional conservation priorities and biogeographical context. Here, we evaluate the arthropod biodiversity in a chronosequence of pine plantation (clear-felled, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 21-years) in the largest lowland conifer forest in the UK. We compare the assemblage within 37 plantation stands and eight important open habitat remnants in a formerly heathland dominated region. We also assess the configuration and potential isolation of ephemeral open early growth stage habitat across a 60-year plantation rotation. Carabid and spider assemblages changed throughout the sampled chronosequence. In the early growth stages (1--7 years) before canopy closure, arthropod assemblages contained many individuals and species associated with dry-open habitats, greater numbers of rare species than closed canopy plantation and had similar composition (non-metric multidimensional scaling) to heathland samples. Early growth stages and heathlands primarily differed in the additional presence of generalist species in the plantation. Species associated with woodland increased in abundance as the plantation aged, but remained far less numerous than dry-open or generalist species. The spatial distribution of young growth stages across the rotation cycle was significantly clustered in the early and late rotation phases. Plantation landscapes often support high species richness but we highlight their value for vulnerable heathland biodiversity early in the rotation cycle. To increase plantation value regional conservation priorities should be supported with appropriate consideration of growth stage configuration across the full rotation.},

  abstract = {The species composition of a community is driven by the dispersal capacity of the species forming that community and their ecological niche. While the ecological niches of EPTs (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) are well-studied due to their wide use as indicators for the ecological status of freshwater ecosystems, their dispersal capacity has not yet been accurately characterized. Dispersion of the merolimnic EPT species during the terrestrial aerial adult stage is of special importance because the distance dispersed by active flight or passive wind drift is usually much larger compared to dispersion during the aquatic larval stage by active crawling or by drifting downstream. The aerial dispersal distance has been directly measured for only a small number of EPT species. For most other species, the dispersal capacity is assessed indirectly using species' traits that are mainly based on expert judgement and dispersal indices derived from trait information. In this study, we compiled a database of European EPTs' aerial dispersal distances reported in empirical studies and compared them to the dispersal capacity of the species as described by five different dispersal indices (original and modified versions of Li's Dispersal Capacity Metric DCM and Sarremejane's Species Flying Propensity SFP as well as relative wing length). The database included empirical data on 180 species, comprising 9.3\% of European EPT species. Most data came from trap experiments with traps located at different distances from the assumed emergence point. Since the distance classes differed between studies and had to be translated to a fixed set of four distance classes here, several species had to be assigned to more than one class. To account for this uncertainty, five ordered logistic regression models, each one with a dispersal index as predictor and the ordinal-scaled aerial dispersal distance as response, were bootstrapped 10,000 times. In each run, species belonging to several distance classes were randomly assigned to a single class out of all possible classes. Since wing length had no significant effect on aerial dispersal distance in any of the 10,000 bootstrap runs, we question the use of this anatomical trait as an indicator for the aerial dispersal capacity. In contrast, a modified version of the DCM index was consistently related to the aerial dispersal distances (96\%). The original SFP index had a significant effect in 100\% of the model runs, indicating that this index is very well-suited as an indicator for the aerial dispersal capacity of European EPT species. This study facilitates the assessment of European EPT flying distances by providing a compilation of empirical data on the topic and by recommending an accurate indirect method when empirical data is not available.},

  abstract = {Establishing relationships between species distributions and environmental characteristics is a major goal in the search for forces driving species distributions. Canonical ordinations such as redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis are invaluable tools for modeling communities through environmental predictors. They provide the means for conducting direct explanatory analysis in which the association among species can be studied according to their common and unique relationships with the environmental variables and other sets of predictors of interest, such as spatial variables. Variation partitioning can then be used to test and determine the likelihood of these sets of predictors in explaining patterns in community structure. Although variation partitioning in canonical analysis is routinely used in ecological analysis, no effort has been reported in the literature to consider appropriate estimators so that comparisons between fractions or, eventually, between different canonical models are meaningful. In this paper, we show that variation partitioning as currently applied in canonical analysis is biased. We present appropriate unbiased estimators. In addition, we outline a statistical test to compare fractions in canonical analysis. The question addressed by the test is whether two fractions of variation are significantly different from each other. Such assessment provides an important step toward attaining an understanding of the factors patterning community structure. The test is shown to have correct Type I error rates and good power for both redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis.},

They show great promise as a general analytical framework for community ecology and macroecology, but current JSDMs, even when approximated by latent variables, scale poorly on large datasets, limiting their usefulness for currently emerging big (e.g. metabarcoding and metagenomics) community datasets. Here, we present a novel, more scalable JSDM (sjSDM) that circumvents the need to use latent variables by using a Monte Carlo integration of the joint JSDM likelihood together with flexible elastic net regularization on all model components. We implemented sjSDM in PyTorch, a modern machine learning framework, which allows making use of both CPU and GPU calculations. Using simulated communities with known species--species associations and different number of species and sites, we compare sjSDM with state-of-the-art JSDM implementations to determine computational runtimes and accuracy of the inferred species--species and species--environment associations. We find that sjSDM is orders of magnitude faster than existing JSDM algorithms (even when run on the CPU) and can be scaled to very large datasets. Despite the dramatically improved speed, sjSDM produces more accurate estimates of species association structures than alternative JSDM implementations. We demonstrate the applicability of sjSDM to big community data using eDNA case study with thousands of fungi operational taxonomic units (OTU). Our sjSDM approach makes the analysis of JSDMs to large community datasets with hundreds or thousands of species possible, substantially extending the applicability of JSDMs in ecology. We provide our method in an R package to facilitate its applicability for practical data analysis.},

  abstract = {RETHINKING THE ROMANTIC SUBLIMEHow did the Romantics conceive of the sublime? This question, to which I will return, is less easily answered than a related one: how have critics conceived of the Romantic sublime? In the critical literature, ``the Romantic sublime'' refers to the mind's transcendence of a natural and/or social world that finally cannot fulfill its desire. Revealed in the moment of the sublime is that the mind is not wholly of the world, but this revelation may be triggered by a particular setting in the world. The lonely grandeur of lakes and mountains, or the solemn interior of a cathedral, invite sublime musings. And these musings are typically conveyed in a heightened style that may itself be described as sublime or awe inspiring. Often cited as the epitome of the Romantic sublime is a passage from book 6 of William Wordsworth's 1805 Prelude:Our destiny, our nature, and our home, Is with infinitude -- and only there; With hope it is, hope that can never die, Effort, and expectation, and desire, And something evermore about to be. The mind beneath such banners militant Thinks not of spoils or trophies, nor of aught That may attest its prowess, blest in thoughts That are their own perfection and reward -- Strong in itself, and in the access of joy Which hides it like the overflowing Nile.At this point in his narrative, Wordsworth has just crossed the Alps unwittingly, failing en route to achieve the grand prospect view he earlier imagined. He turns from his disappointment to praise the imagination as a power superior to any actual experience and to celebrate, in these lines, the soul as fundamentally alien to the world of the senses. Wordsworth expresses a yearning for the infinite, the unbounded, the supersensible; he expresses, as though it were a natural or intuitive aspect of our being, the desire to transcend the limitations imposed on us as finite, historically situated beings. Although this yearning evidently has religious roots (particularly neo-Platonic and Augustinian ones), its quasi-secular or at least nonsectarian expression comprises what we now think of as the Romantic sublime. Whether or not this yearning aptly or sufficiently characterizes what authors of the Romantic era actually took to be sublime is a question I shall address in this chapter.},

Environmental gradients exist at several spatial scales and can be nested hierarchically, influencing patterns of plant diversity in complex ways. As plant community dynamics influence ecosystem function, understanding the drivers of plant community variability across space is paramount for predicting potential shifts in ecosystem function from global change. Determining the scales at which stress gradients influence vegetation composition is crucial to inform management and restoration of tidal marshes for specific functions. Here, we analyzed vegetation community composition in 51 tidal marshes from the San Francisco Bay Estuary, California, USA. We used model-based compositional analysis and rank abundance curves to quantify environmental (elevation/tidal frame position, distance to channel, and channel salinity) and species trait (species form, wetland indicator status, and native status) influences on plant community variability at the marsh site and estuary scales. While environmental impacts on plant diversity varied by species and their relationships to each other, overall impacts increased in strength from marsh to estuary scales. Relative species abundance was important in structuring these tidal marsh communities even with the limited species pools dominated by a few species. Rank abundance curves revealed different community structures by region with higher species evenness at plots higher in the tidal frame and adjacent to freshwater channels. By identifying interactions (species--species, species--environment, and environment--trait) at multiple scales (local, landscape), we begin to understand how variability measurements could be interpreted for conservation and land management decisions.},

  abstract = {Biological invasions are a leading threat to biodiversity globally. Increasingly, ecosystems experience multiple introductions, which can have significant effects on patterns of diversity. The way these communities assemble will depend partly on whether rare and common alien species respond to environmental predictors in the same manner as rare and common native species, but this is not well understood. To examine this question across four national parks in south-eastern Australia, we sampled the understory plant community of eucalypt-dominated dry forest subject to multiple plant introductions. The drivers of diversity and turnover in alien and native species of contrasting frequency of occurrence (low, intermediate, and high) were each tested individually. We found alien species diversity and turnover were both strongly associated with abiotic conditions (e.g., soil pH), while distance had little influence because of the greater extent of occurrence and more homogeneous composition of common aliens. In contrast, native species diversity was not associated with abiotic conditions and their turnover was as strongly influenced by distance as by abiotic conditions. In both alien and native species, however, the most important predictors of turnover changed with frequency of occurrence. Although local coexistence appears to be facilitated by life history trade-offs, species richness of aliens and natives was negatively correlated and native species might face greater competition in areas with more neutral soils (e.g., pH {$>$} 5.5) where alien richness and relative frequency were both highest. We conclude that diversity and turnover in the generally more widespread alien species are mainly driven by species sorting along an environmental gradient associated with pH and nutrient availability, whereas turnover of native species is driven by more neutral processes associated with dispersal limitation. We show alien and native plant species respond to different environmental factors, as do rare and common species within each component.},

From 2000 to 2012, we monitored understory plant communities in a woodland mosaic in Missouri, USA, as it underwent restoration via prescribed, dormant-season burning and mechanical thinning of red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) and exotic shrubs. Native species richness increased linearly by 36\% over this time period, driven primarily by an influx of forb species in thin-soiled upland areas where red cedar was removed. Floristic quality also increased with differential dynamics across local communities; forest floristic quality saturated quickly whereas floristic quality increased gradually over the time series in woodlands and red cedar--dominated woodlands. Species that underlay these patterns were mainly ruderal or matrix forbs and grasses with little dependence on intact, undisturbed habitats. In contrast, conservative species were rare or absent. This case study suggests that understory plant recovery dynamics may be slower in harsher and more degraded sites and faster in more mesic sites within a woodland mosaic. Our observations set a benchmark for woodland understory plant recovery dynamics and indicate that a future restoration challenge is to prioritize the managed translocation of dispersal-limited, conservative species.},

We evaluated the impact of initial restoration intervention, landscape composition, and elapsed time since the restoration began on the long-term progress of Pannonic sand grassland restoration. Treatments (seeding, mowing, and carbon amendment) were implemented for 6--7~years and monitoring lasted up to 23~years after the first treatment applications in eight experimental blocks belonging to three field experiments. The abundance of target/neophyte species, and distance from primary grasslands and plantations (as major source of target/neophyte species) were estimated in 500~m landscape buffers around each block to characterize landscape composition. Restoration progress was calculated as the difference between the relative cover of target/neophyte species in treatment and control plots. Restoration intervention and neophyte abundance in the landscape had a significant effect on the restoration progress, but time did not. Seeding had the highest positive effect on target species and also prevented invasion by neophyte species. Higher abundance of neophytes in the landscape and the proximity to plantations increased the cover of neophytes in treatment plots. We conclude that restoration interventions may have a greater impact on restoration progress in the longer term than landscape factors or elapsed time. Seeding proved to be the best method in restoring sand grasslands by both favoring target species and controlling invasion. From the landscape factors, the abundance of neophyte species and distance to plantations should be considered when prioritizing areas and efforts for restoration.},

We leverage recent progress in Bayesian latent variable models to implement a computationally effective algorithm that enables one to consider large communities and extensive sampling schemes. We exemplify the framework with a community of 98 fungal species sampled in c. 22 500 dead wood units in 230 plots in 29 beech forests. The networks identified by correlations and partial correlations were consistent, as were networks for natural and managed forests, but networks at different spatial scales were dissimilar.

  abstract = {Biodiversity conservation faces a methodological conundrum: Biodiversity measurement often relies on species, most of which are rare at various scales, especially prone to extinction under global change, but also the most challenging to sample and model. Predicting the distribution change of rare species using conventional species distribution models is challenging because rare species are hardly captured by most survey systems. When enough data are available, predictions are usually spatially biased towards locations where the species is most likely to occur, violating the assumptions of many modelling frameworks. Workflows to predict and eventually map rare species distributions imply important trade-offs between data quantity, quality, representativeness and model complexity that need to be considered prior to survey and analysis. Our opinion is that study designs need to carefully integrate the different steps, from species sampling to modelling, in accordance with the different types of rarity and available data in order to improve our capacity for sound assessment and prediction of rare species distribution. In this article, we summarize and comment on how different categories of species rarity lead to different types of occurrence and distribution data depending on choices made during the survey process, namely the spatial distribution of samples (where to sample) and the sampling protocol in each selected location (how to sample). We then clarify which species distribution models are suitable depending on the different types of distribution data (how to model). Among others, for most rarity forms, we highlight the insights from systematic species-targeted sampling coupled with hierarchical models that allow correcting for overdispersion and spatial and sampling sources of bias. Our article provides scientists and practitioners with a much-needed guide through the ever-increasing diversity of methodological developments to improve the prediction of rare species distribution depending on rarity type and available data.},

Our algorithm makes these tools generally available to analysts of discrete data and can combine any likelihood-based covariance modeling method for Gaussian data with any set of discrete marginal distributions. Previously, tools for discrete data were generally specific to one family of distributions or covariance modeling paradigm, or otherwise did not exist. Our algorithm is more flexible than alternate methods, takes advantage of existing fast algorithms for Gaussian data, and simulations suggest that it outperforms competing graphical modeling and factor analysis procedures for count and binomial data. We additionally show that in a Gaussian copula graphical model with discrete margins, conditional independence relationships in the latent Gaussian variables are inherited by the discrete observations. Our method is illustrated with a graphical model and factor analysis on an overdispersed ecological count dataset of species abundances.},

  abstract = {In 2015, the Fund{\~a}o Dam collapse released over 40 million m3 of iron mine tailings, causing several environmental damages. Certain affected areas were revegetated with a mix of fast-growing species that can allowed the return of some organisms of soil fauna. Nematodes are the most abundant multicellular organisms in soil and are commonly used as bioindicators. Therefore, this study aimed to use the nematode community as bioindicators of the restoration process of an area affected by iron tailings at the margins of the Gualaxo do Norte River. Soil samples were collected from affected and native forest areas to perform physical, chemical, biochemical, and biological analyses. Nematodes were identified and classified according to feeding habits and on a colonizer-persisters (cp) scale. A non-metrical multidimensional scaling and PERMANOVA were conducted to assess differences between communities. Shannon's diversity index and the maturity index were significantly higher in the restoration area. There was a difference in the composition and the structure of nematode communities of the restoration and reference area, nematode genus occurrence and abundance were different between the areas resulting in differences in feeding habits and life strategies according to the cp scale. The cp-5 nematodes are more abundant in the restoration area and cp-1 in the forest reference area. Bacterivore nematodes were more abundant in the reference forest area. In addition, the soil attributes in the restoration area were altered following the tailings deposition. Such alterations include high pH, low organic matter content, and low microbial biomass, which consequently influenced the structure and the composition of the nematode community. This is likely the first report of soil nematode community diversity in the areas of the Rio Doce Basin impacted by the Fund{\~a}o tailings, and nematodes proved to be good bioindicators to show the differences between the restoration and forest reference area.},

  abstract = {In the light of declining biodiversity, monitoring its fate is essential for conservation strategies. Aggregation of temporal change of different species into multi-species indices such as geometric means makes it possible to identify species groups that are at risk as well as those that are doing well. However, aggregated indices mask the between-species variability in the temporal trajectories, which could be of high relevance for conservation actions. We propose a toolbox, available as an r package, to investigate compositions of species dynamics in geometric mean multi-species indices. The toolbox is based on a dynamic factor analysis which uses species dynamics and their uncertainty to (1) identify common latent trends in those species dynamics, (2) display the variability of species dynamics and (3) extract clusters of species with similar dynamics within the species groups used for the indices. We apply the toolbox to common breeding birds in Sweden and explore the variability in dynamics among species included in EU-official indices for farmland and woodland species, highlighting clusters of species with related dynamics previously hidden by averaging. The toolbox is designed to be applicable to a wide range of ecological monitoring data. By enabling a deeper exploration of the structure behind existing indices, we may refine our understanding of biodiversity change to better inform subsequent conservation policies.},

  abstract = {Distance-based ordinations have played a critical role in community ecology for more than half a century, but are still under active development. These methods employ a matrix of pairwise distances or dissimilarities between sample units, and map sample units from the high-dimensional distance or dissimilarity space to a low-dimensional representation for analysis. Distance- or dissimilarity-based methods employ continuum or gradient ecological theory and a variety of statistical models to achieve the mapping. Recently, ecologists have developed model-based ordinations based on latent vectors and individual species response models. These methods employ the individualistic perspective of Gleason as the ecological model, and Bayesian or maximum-likelihood methods to estimate the parameters for the low dimensional space represented by the latent vectors. In this research I compared two distance-based methods (NMDS and t-SNE) with two model-based methods (BORAL and REO) on five data sets to determine which methods are superior for (1) extracting meaningful ecological drivers of variability in community composition, and (2) estimating sample unit locations in ordination space that maximize the goodness-of-fit of individual species response models to the estimated sample unit locations. Environmental variables and species were fitted to the ordinations by generalized additive models (GAMs) with Gaussian, negative binomial, or Poisson distribution models as appropriate. Across the five data sets, 22 models of environmental variability and 449 models of species distributions were calculated for each of the ordination methods. To minimize the effects of stochasticity the entire analysis was replicated three times and results averaged across the replicates. Results were evaluated by deviance explained and AIC for environmental variables and species distributions, averaged by ordination method for each data set, and ranked from best to worst. For the four assessments distance-based methods ranked 1 and 2 in three cases, and 1 and 3 in one case, significantly out performing the model-based methods. t-SNE was the top-performing method, out performing NMDS especially on the more complex data sets. In general the gradient-based theoretical basis and data sufficiency of distance-based methods allowed distance-based methods to outperform model-based methods in every assessment.},

  abstract = {Volcanic eruptions are an important natural cause of climate change on many timescales. A new capability to predict the climatic response to a large tropical eruption for the succeeding 2 years will prove valuable to society. In addition, to detect and attribute anthropogenic influences on climate, including effects of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and ozone-depleting chemicals, it is crucial to quantify the natural fluctuations so as to separate them from anthropogenic fluctuations in the climate record. Studying the responses of climate to volcanic eruptions also helps us to better understand important radiative and dynamical processes that respond in the climate system to both natural and anthropogenic forcings. Furthermore, modeling the effects of volcanic eruptions helps us to improve climate models that are needed to study anthropogenic effects. Large volcanic eruptions inject sulfur gases into the stratosphere, which convert to sulfate aerosols with an e-folding residence time of about 1 year. Large ash particles fall out much quicker. The radiative and chemical effects of this aerosol cloud produce responses in the climate system. By scattering some solar radiation back to space, the aerosols cool the surface, but by absorbing both solar and terrestrial radiation, the aerosol layer heats the stratosphere. For a tropical eruption this heating is larger in the tropics than in the high latitudes, producing an enhanced pole-to-equator temperature gradient, especially in winter. In the Northern Hemisphere winter this enhanced gradient produces a stronger polar vortex, and this stronger jet stream produces a characteristic stationary wave pattern of tropospheric circulation, resulting in winter warming of Northern Hemisphere continents. This indirect advective effect on temperature is stronger than the radiative cooling effect that dominates at lower latitudes and in the summer. The volcanic aerosols also serve as surfaces for heterogeneous chemical reactions that destroy stratospheric ozone, which lowers ultraviolet absorption and reduces the radiative heating in the lower stratosphere, but the net effect is still heating. Because this chemical effect depends on the presence of anthropogenic chlorine, it has only become important in recent decades. For a few days after an eruption the amplitude of the diurnal cycle of surface air temperature is reduced under the cloud. On a much longer timescale, volcanic effects played a large role in interdecadal climate change of the Little Ice Age. There is no perfect index of past volcanism, but more ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica will improve the record. There is no evidence that volcanic eruptions produce El Ni{\~n}o events, but the climatic effects of El Ni{\~n}o and volcanic eruptions must be separated to understand the climatic response to each.}

In their original form, they contain the likelihood of the data given the models. Unfortunately, in many applications, it is practically impossible to calculate the likelihood, and, therefore, the criteria have been reformulated in terms of descriptive statistics of the residual distribution: the variance and the mean-squared error of the residuals. These alternative versions are strictly valid only in the presence of additive noise of Gaussian distribution, not a completely satisfactory assumption in many applications in science and engineering. Moreover, the variance and the mean-squared error are quite crude statistics of the residual distributions. More sophisticated statistical indicators, capable of better quantifying how close the residual distribution is to the noise, can be profitably used. In particular, specific goodness of fit tests have been included in the expressions of the traditional criteria and have proved to be very effective in improving their discriminating capability. These improved performances have been demonstrated with a systematic series of simulations using synthetic data for various classes of functions and different noise statistics.},

  abstract = {Species occurrence is influenced by environmental conditions and the presence of other species. Current approaches for multispecies occupancy modelling are practically limited to two interacting species and often require the assumption of asymmetric interactions. We propose a multispecies occupancy model that can accommodate two or more interacting species. We generalize the single-species occupancy model to two or more interacting species by assuming the latent occupancy state is a multivariate Bernoulli random variable. We propose modelling the probability of each potential latent occupancy state with both a multinomial logit and a multinomial probit model and present details of a Gibbs sampler for the latter. As an example, we model co-occurrence probabilities of bobcat (Lynx rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), grey fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) as a function of human disturbance variables throughout 6 Mid-Atlantic states in the eastern United States. We found evidence for pairwise interactions among most species, and the probability of some pairs of species occupying the same site varied along environmental gradients; for example, occupancy probabilities of coyote and grey fox were independent at sites with little human disturbance, but these two species were more likely to occur together at sites with high human disturbance. Ecological communities are composed of multiple interacting species. Our proposed method improves our ability to draw inference from such communities by permitting modelling of detection/non-detection data from an arbitrary number of species, without assuming asymmetric interactions. Additionally, our proposed method permits modelling the probability two or more species occur together as a function of environmental variables. These advancements represent an important improvement in our ability to draw community-level inference from multiple interacting species that are subject to imperfect detection.},

  abstract = {Species composition is a vital attribute of any ecosystem. Accordingly, ecological restoration often has the original, or ``natural,'' species composition as its target. However, we still lack adequate methods for predicting the expected time to compositional recovery in restoration studies. We describe and explore a new, ordination regression-based approach (ORBA) for predicting time to recovery that allows both linear and asymptotic (logarithmic) relationships of compositional change with time. The approach uses distances between restored plots and reference plots along the successional gradient, represented by a vector in ordination space, to predict time to recovery. Thus, the approach rests on three requirements: (a) the general form of the relationship between compositional change and time must be known; (b) a sufficiently strong successional gradient must be present and adequately represented in a species compositional dataset; and (c) a restoration target must be specified. We tested the approach using data from a boreal old-growth forest that was followed for 18 years after experimental disturbance. Data from the first 9 years after disturbance were used to develop models, the subsequent 9 years for validation. Rates of compositional recovery in the example dataset followed the general pattern of decrease with time since disturbance. Accordingly, linear models were too optimistic about the time to recovery, whereas the asymptotic models provided more precise predictions. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that the new approach opens for reliable prediction of recovery rates and time to recovery using species compositional data. Moreover, it allows us to assess whether recovery proceeds in the desired direction and to quantitatively compare restoration speed, and hence effectiveness, between alternative management options.},

  abstract = {Restoration of degraded ecosystems may take decades or even centuries. Accordingly, information about the current direction and speed of recovery provided by methods for predicting time to recovery may give important feedback to restoration schemes. While predictions of time to recovery have so far been based mostly upon change in species richness and other univariate predictors, the novel ordination-regression based approach (ORBA) affords a multivariate approach based upon species compositional change. We used species composition data from four alpine spoil heaps in western Norway, recorded at three time points, to predict time to recovery using ORBA. This approach uses distances between restored plots and reference plots along a successional gradient, represented by a vector in ordination space, to model linear or asymptotic relationships of compositional change as a function of time. Results from ORBA were compared with results from models of more generic univariate attributes, that is total cover, species richness and properties of the physical environment as functions of time. ORBA predictions of time to species compositional recovery varied from less than 60 years with linear models to 115--212 years with asymptotic models. The long estimated time to recovery suggests that the restoration schemes adopted for these spoil heaps are likely to be suboptimal. Much shorter time to recovery was predicted from some of the more generic univariate attributes, that is species richness and total cover, than from species composition. Given the current rates of recovery, most spoil heaps will reach reference levels for total cover and species richness within 50 years, whereas predictions indicate that 67--111 years are needed to restore levels of soil organic matter and pH. Synthesis and applications. Species composition and soil conditions provide information of generally higher relevance for evaluation of ecosystem recovery processes than the most commonly used metric to assess restoration success, species richness. Species richness is decoupled from species compositional recovery, and likely to be a generally poor measure of restoration success. We therefore encourage further improvement of methods like the ordination-regression based approach that use species compositional data to predict time to recovery.},

  abstract = {The Antarctic Peninsula (AP) is one of the three places on Earth that registered the most intense warming in the last 50 years, almost five times the global mean. This warming has strongly affected the cryosphere, causing the largest ice-shelf collapses ever observed and the retreat of 87\% of glaciers. Ecosystem responses, although increasingly predicted, have been mainly reported for pelagic systems. However, and despite most Antarctic species being benthic, responses in the Antarctic benthos have been detected in only a few species, and major effects at assemblage level are unknown. This is probably due to the scarcity of baselines against which to assess change. We performed repeat surveys of coastal benthos in 1994, 1998, and 2010, analyzing community structure and environmental variables at King George Island, Antarctica. We report a marked shift in an Antarctic benthic community that can be linked to ongoing climate change. However, rather than temperature as the primary factor, we highlight the resulting increased sediment runoff, triggered by glacier retreat, as the potential causal factor. The sudden shift from a ``filter feeders--ascidian domination'' to a ``mixed assemblage'' suggests that thresholds (for example, of tolerable sedimentation) and alternative equilibrium states, depending on the reversibility of the changes, could be possible traits of this ecosystem. Sedimentation processes will be increasing under the current scenario of glacier retreat, and attention needs to be paid to its effects along the AP.},

  abstract = {Urban development has drastically altered ecosystems with dramatic effects on avian diversity and community structure. Most studies investigating this phenomenon are conducted in large and established cities, with fewer conducted in areas of current urbanization. Measuring avian community structure in recently established and growing cities is necessary to understand which species are being affected in a range of urban environments. There is also a critical need to explore multiple measures of urbanization, as different axes of human influence might have varied effects on wildlife. This study investigated the relationship between avian communities and urban noise, light, and landscape composition in Weld County, CO, one of the United States' fastest growing metropolitan areas. We tested the general hypothesis that avian community assemblages would vary with multiple urban characteristics. We measured noise, light, and landscape composition across 16 sites ranging from urban to non-urban and paired these data with avian species census data. We used multivariate analyses to test for covariance of our three measures of urban characteristics, and to examine patterns of species presence and abundances at sites. Results suggest that developed land and water covary with avian community structure across our study sites. Anthropogenic noise and light did not drive avian community patterns as strongly as percent developed land and water. These three urban characteristics did not covary or form a linear urban to non-urban gradient, suggesting that urbanization can have patchy and unpredictable effects, highlighting the value of measuring urban characteristics separately.},

The aim of this study is to perform a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of the FC model in learning in the field of experimental and health sciences in higher education during the 2014-2021 period, specifically in students' performance, determining the influence of students' motivation and self-regulation during the process. The phases and quality standards for systematic reviews were complied with in the search for and compilation of the articles analysed. Science students generally view FC as satisfactory. The results show increased motivation and self-regulation and, by extension, a general positive impact on academic performance as benefits. Furthermore, motivation and self-regulation are regarded as key requirements for good performance in an FC environment in the sciences. However, to achieve good results, FC must be applied in such a way that students are able to reflect on their own learning process.},

  abstract = {The 2014--2016 northeast Pacific marine heatwave (MHW) disrupted marine ecosystems in California, with well-documented impacts on kelp reef ecosystems, and deep reef fish assemblages. However, no studies have assessed the direct or indirect impacts on sessile benthic reef invertebrates inhabiting mesophotic rocky reefs ({$>$}30~m deep), despite their critical role in biodiversity and ecosystem function. Given that much of California's rocky reefs lie within mesophotic depths, understanding their responses to climate-driven disturbances is a high priority. Using remote operated vehicles surveys conducted from 2005 to 2021 across marine protected areas (MPAs) and habitat-matched reference sites, we quantified changes in sessile invertebrate abundance, both independently and in relation to urchin presence, during and after the MHW. Community responses varied across a five-degree latitudinal gradient (33.87{$^\circ$}- 38.97{$^\circ$}N), with no consistent differences attributable to MPA designation. Sponges and California hydrocorals increased regionally, while red and purple gorgonians, elephant ear tunicates, and sea whips declined during the MHW and remained suppressed five years later. Although surface warming reached mesophotic depths at some sites, temperatures remained within typical ranges, suggesting the MHW event may not be the primary driver of the observed changes. Instead, broader ecosystem perturbations likely facilitated red sea urchin expansion into mesophotic depths from 2015 onwards. Their presence was associated with declines in several species, representing a potential indirect pathway through which this climate disturbance affects mesophotic assemblages. These findings highlight the need for depth-resolved monitoring to assess changes in this understudied ecosystem and to identify mesophotic refugia at thermally stable sites.},

  abstract = {Understanding the relationships between organisms and their environment is crucial to determining important areas for conservation and monitoring. In rapidly changing oceans, one approach to quantify these relationships is to identify species assemblages. This study used a nine year dataset of seabird observations sampled approximately every two months during a cross-shelf transect to describe assemblages at the Subtropical Frontal Zone, in southeast Aotearoa/New Zealand. During 36 voyages, 47 species and a minimum of 69,025 individual birds were recorded. We used multivariate, model-based ordinations to identify assemblages against spatial (distance from the coast), temporal (season) and environmental (water mass) predictors. The multivariate models suggest that the distance from the coast and seasons explain most of the observed variability. Gulls and shags influenced a coastal assemblage ({$<$}25 km from the coast), and most albatrosses and petrels were only recorded offshore ({$>$}35 km). Seasons strongly influenced the assemblages, with 31 of the 39 analysed species classified as migratory or dispersive. Over the nine year dataset, the probability of occurrence of nearly 40\% of the analysed species changed, indicating possible changes in the assemblage structure and species' ranges. This study shows the importance of accounting for seasonality when describing assemblages in regions supporting high proportions of migratory and/or wide-ranging species. The observed changes in the probability of occurrence of several species may be the first evidence for the effects of oceanographic changes recently described for the southwest Pacific Ocean due to above-average warming caused by climate change.},

In this study, we utilized phytosociological principles to investigate the impact of ecological factors on the community types of WMPs in Ada'a district. Through stratified random sampling, data were collected from 59 plots, encompassing both ethnomedicinal flora and environmental parameters. The result of `clara' partitioning method revealed six distinct community types of WMPs which have significant differences (Cophenetic correlation coefficient~=~0.801, P~{$<~$}0.001) among themselves. Moreover, the Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) identified elevation, sand, organic matter (OM), phosphorus (P), and grazing as primary factors that influenc the spatial variations in species composition of the medicinal plants. The study provides vital insights into the diversity and spatial dynamics of wild medicinal plants in Ada'a district, emphasizing the need for conservation efforts. We recommend prioritizing in-situ conservation in highland forests and wetland areas as they are recognized as key habitats for diverse medicinal plant resources so as to ensure sustainable utilization.},

We propose that uncertainty reporting in ecology and evolution can be improved through wider application of existing statistical solutions and by adopting good practice from other scientific fields.

A 10-year pitfall study of carabid assemblages (Coleoptera, Carabidae) was carried out in pine stands disturbed by windthrow (Pisz Forest, North Poland) in the first year after the disturbance, with different classes of severity: severely disturbed stands (canopy cover up to 30\%), moderately disturbed stands (canopy cover of 40-60\%) and least disturbed stands (canopy cover of 70-90\%). 3. Based on the number of carabid species and their ecological traits, I confirmed the hypothesis that the amplitude of changes in carabid assemblages inhabiting severely and moderately disturbed stands would be greater than in the least disturbed stands. Variation in carabid assemblages was also linked to soil pH and to carbon and nitrogen content in the soil. 4. The study confirmed my hypothesis regarding the delayed replacement of late successional carabid fauna by early successional fauna, which was linked to the broken pines lying on the soil, allowing late successional fauna to survive in the first few years after the windthrow. 5. The principal response curve analysis identified three phases of post-disturbance succession in carabid assemblages: (i) slight changes in the number of species and their ecological traits, lasting for 4years; (ii) rapid' changes, lasting for 3years, involving an increase in the number of species and rapid replacement of late successional carabid fauna by early successional fauna; and (iii) the slow recovery of late carabid successional fauna.},

  abstract = {The paper discusses modeling the dynamics of nickel concentration in soils, water, and the bottom sediments of lakes caused by atmospheric emissions from the Pechenganickel plant, Kola Peninsula, throughout its whole operation period. The applied technology of balanced identification makes it possible to use a mathematical description of heterogeneous geochemical processes in ecosystems to combine heterogeneous experimental data and build up a computer model with an optimal balance of its complexity and fitting quality of the data. The model is used to analyze the spatial and temporal variability of natural objects in the zone of distribution of atmospheric pollution (nickel) from the Pechenganickel plant. The paper presents and discusses results of this study, including estimates of the retrospective state of the simulated objects (before the start of the intense studies) and a forecast of their dynamics until 2030. According to the model calculations, the intensity of Ni accumulation in the soil and bottom sediments was 2.35 and 4.48 mg/(m2 year) during the maximum deposition periods (1980--2005), whereas the model predicts a decrease in the intensity of Ni accumulation in the bottom sediments (0.23 mg/(m2 year)) and slow Ni leaching from the soil (0.19 mg/(m2 year)) after the shutdown of the plant.},

Soil microbial communities are of crucial importance to maintain plant diversity due to harsh environmental conditions, water limitation and nutrient scarcity. Invasive alien plants represent a major threat to ecosystem conservation. Here, we explored different impacts of Carpobrotus edulis, a succulent plant invading coastal areas worldwide, on the function and structure of bacterial communities. Sand represents a challenging substrate due to low organic matter content and limited microbial activity. We optimized bacterial extraction for functional evaluation before assessing ecosystem impacts produced by C. edulis. We compared 12 extracting procedures combining different soil storage, sample amount and extracting solutions on the functional activity of sand communities through the community-level physiological profile. We further explored the function (using Biolog Ecoplates) and structure [using polymerase chain reaction--denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE)] of bacterial communities from dunes invaded by C. edulis. Saline solution consistently increased bacterial cells detected by cytometry (P {$\leq$} 0.001). Principal component analysis suggested a limited temporal framework (0--24 h) in which community function can be explored without significant alterations in C substrate consumption. Changes under C. edulis invasion exhibited a different pattern of C substrate utilization comparing native and non-native zones (interspecific), but also between native zones (intraspecific), suggesting that functional impacts are site-dependent. Complementary, results obtained from PCR-DGGE indicated that the bacterial community structure of native dunes significantly differed from dunes invaded by C. edulis.},

Although the ash gravitationally settles out within weeks, the aerosols spread around the globe and can remain suspended in the stratosphere for years. Because solar radiation is easily absorbed and backscattered by the volcanic particles, a haziness in the sky and a dimming of the Sun and Moon are produced. Very dense and widespread dry fogs occur, on the average, once every few centuries1--3. The sizes and intensities of some of the largest of them before the modern scientific era have been estimated by several indirect methods2,4,5. The densest and most persistent dry fog on record was observed in Europe and the Middle East during AD 536 and 537. Despite the earliness of the date, there is sufficient detailed information to estimate the optical depth and mass of this remarkable stratospheric dust cloud. The importance of this cloud resides in the fact that its mass and its climatic consequences appear to exceed those of any other volcanic cloud observed during the past three millenia. Although the volcano responsible remains a mystery, a tropical location (perhaps the volcano Rabaul on the island of New Britain, Papua New Guinea) can be tentatively inferred.}

  abstract = {Worldwide, ecosystems are suffering important taxonomic and functional modifications in response to anthropogenic disturbances, operating at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Awareness on biodiversity losses has led to the adoption of conservation policies and the development of programs devoted to the conservation and the restoration of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. The assessment of the ecological health of ecosystems requires measuring and characterizing restoration or degradation dynamics and their consequences on the ecological quality with respect to reference conditions defined pragmatically as conservation targets. Methodological innovations, in terms of data collection, analysis, and visualization, have an important influence on the ability of ecologists to understand biodiversity changes. The assessment of the quality of ecosystems with respect to reference conditions requires to address, notably, three main challenges: the definition of reference conditions, the assessment of the degree of achievement of conservation objectives, and the qualitative and quantitative characterization of recovering and departing patterns. We propose here the ecological quality assessment (EQA) framework as a data-driven approach to track ecological quality focusing on the distance of the tested stations with respect to a chosen reference envelope using fuzzy logic and trajectory analysis. We take advantage of those analytical tools to propose a general and flexible multivariate framework by quantifying the achievement of reference conditions, measuring restoration and degradation dynamics when temporal series are available, and representing and synthesizing this information. To take into account the natural spatiotemporal variability of sites considered as reference, we gave two variants to our framework: a state-based variant when no temporal replications are available and a trajectory-based variant specially devoted to compare whole trajectories to a trajectory reference envelope defined by a set of reference trajectories. These two complementary approaches were illustrated through two terrestrial and marine ecological applications using the R package ``ecotraj'' in order to evidence ecological observations that meet conservation objectives from those that do not meet them. EQA constitutes a flexible framework for the assessment and reporting of ecosystem quality, including restoration and degradation dynamics adaptable to multiple questions in the different fields of ecology and conservation.},

  abstract = {Agricultural expansion and intensification are major drivers of global change. Quantifying the importance of different processes governing the assembly of local communities in agroecosystems is essential to guide the conservation effort allocated to enhancing habitat connectivity, improving habitat quality or managing species interactions. We used multiple detection methods to record the occurrence of medium-sized and large-sized mammals in three managed landscapes of a heterogeneous Mediterranean region. Then we used a joint species distribution model to evaluate the relative influence of dispersal limitation, environmental filtering, and interspecific interactions on the local assembly of mammal communities in 4-km2 plots. The partitioning of the explained variation in species occurrence was attributed on average 99\% to environmental filters and 1\% to dispersal filters. No role was attributed to biotic filters, in agreement with the scarce support for strong competition or other negative interactions found after a literature review. Four principal environmental factors explained on average 63\% of variance in species occurrence and operated mainly at the landscape scale. The amount of shrub cover in the neighboring landscape was the most influential factor favoring mammal occurrence and accounted for nearly one-third of the total variance. The proportion of intensively managed croplands and proxies of human activity within landscape samples limited mammal presence. At the microhabitat scale ( 80 m2 plots) the mean percentage area deprived of woody vegetation also had a negative effect. Functional traits such as body mass or social behavior accounted for a substantial fraction of the variation attributed to environmental factors. We concluded that multiscale environmental filtering governed local community assembly, whereas the role of dispersal limitation and interspecific interactions was negligible. Our results suggest that further removal of shrubland, the expansion of intensive agriculture, and the increase of human activity are expected to result in species losses. The fact that community integrity responds to a single type of ecological process simplifies practical recommendations. Management strategies should focus on the conservation and restoration of shrubland, adopting alternatives to intensive schemes of agricultural production, and minimizing recreational and other human activities in remnant natural habitats within agroecosystems or mosaic landscapes.},

  abstract = {A new multivariate analysis technique, developed to relate community composition to known variation in the environment, is described. The technique is an extension of correspondence analysis (reciprocal averaging), a popular ordination technique that extracts continuous axes of variation from species occurrence or abundance data. Such ordination axes are typically interpreted with the help of external knowledge and data on environmental variables; this two---step approach (ordination followed by environmental gradient identification) is termed indirect gradient analysis. In the new technique, called canonical correspondence analysis, ordination axes are chosen in the light of known environmental variables by imposing the extra restriction that the axes be linear combinations of environmental variables. In this way community variation can be directly related to environmental variation. The environmental variables may be quantitative or nominal. As many axes can be extracted as there are environmental variables. The method of detrending can be incorporated in the technique to remove arch effects. (Detrended) canonical correspondence analysis is an efficient ordination technique when species have bell---shaped response curves or surfaces with respect to environmental gradients, and is therefore more appropriate for analyzing data on community composition and environmental variables than canonical correlation analysis. The new technique leads to an ordination diagram in which points represent species and sites, and vectors represent environmental variables. Such a diagram shows the patterns of variation in community composition that can be explained best by the environmental variables and also visualizes approximately the 'centers' of the species distributions along each of the environmental variables. Such diagrams effectively summarized relationships between community and environment for data sets on hunting spiders, dyke vegetation, and algae along a pollution gradient.},

  abstract = {Predicting and explaining the distribution and density of species is one of the oldest concerns in ecology. Species distributions can be estimated using geostatistical methods, which estimate a latent spatial variable explaining observed variation in densities, but geostatistical methods may be imprecise for species with low densities or few observations. Additionally, simple geostatistical methods fail to account for correlations in distribution among species and generally estimate such cross-correlations as a post hoc exercise. We therefore present spatial factor analysis (SFA), a spatial model for estimating a low-rank approximation to multivariate data, and use it to jointly estimate the distribution of multiple species simultaneously. We also derive an analytic estimate of cross-correlations among species from SFA parameters. As a first example, we show that distributions for 10 bird species in the breeding bird survey in 2012 can be parsimoniously represented using only five spatial factors. As a second case study, we show that forward prediction of catches for 20 rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) off the U.S. West Coast is more accurate using SFA than analysing each species individually. Finally, we show that single-species models give a different picture of cross-correlations than joint estimation using SFA. Spatial factor analysis complements a growing list of tools for jointly modelling the distribution of multiple species and provides a parsimonious summary of cross-correlation without requiring explicit declaration of habitat variables. We conclude by proposing future research that would model species cross-correlations using dissimilarity of species' traits, and the development of spatial dynamic factor analysis for a low-rank approximation to spatial time-series data.},

We propose an alternative model that does not assume that any of the interactions are necessarily zero, but summarizes the influences of individual species by a small number of community-level drivers. The community-level drivers are defined as linear combinations of species abundances, and they may thus represent e.g. the total abundance of all species or the relative proportions of different functional groups. We show with simulated and real data how our approach can be used to compare different hypotheses on community structure. In an empirical example using aquatic microorganisms, the community-level drivers model clearly outperformed the sparse interactions model in predicting independent validation data.},

Using a case study of 65 tundra plant species abundances and 3 key functional traits measured across 325 sites, we show how the JSTDM approach (1) estimates the statistical associations among species abundances, species-level traits, and site-level traits, relative to environmental variation; (2) improves predictions on trait variation by using information on species abundances; and (3) generates hypotheses about trait-driven community assembly mechanisms. The JSTDM methodology presented in this study allows assessing the interplay between species abundances and traits at the community level, providing the much needed modeling tools to quantify the role of phenotypic trait variation in eco-evolutionary community assembly.},

Such information is scarce in tropical regions, particularly the Palawan faunal region and island group in the western Philippines. Here we examined the patterns of anuran richness and identified correlations in species co-occurrences and their shared responses to habitat types, water availability, and elevation. We sampled anuran populations using standardized transects established across Palawan's major islands between 2013 and 2019. We generated interpolated and extrapolated richness using Hill numbers. To investigate species co-occurrences and the relative importance of environmental variables, we used Joint Species Distribution Model (JSDM). A total of 18 anuran species were recorded, including seven non-endemic and 11 species restricted to Palawan. Anuran richness was highest in forests habitats than in cultivated land areas. Sites with water sources had higher anuran richness than those without water. Species richness observed along elevational gradient exhibited a hump-shaped pattern. Significant positive correlations in species co-occurrences were found among aquatic and semi-aquatic species. Anuran species showed tight associations with elevation and water availability, indicating that these variables are strong predictors of anuran co-occurrences. Finally, this study broadens our understanding of the differences and similarities in habitat requirements among anuran species, highlighting the need to consider such information when developing conservation strategies other than the traditional vulnerability and irreplaceability measures.},

  abstract = {The language of science is largely metaphorical. Scientists rely on metaphor and analogy to make sense of scientific phenomena and communicate their findings to each other and to the public. Yet, despite their utility, metaphors can also constrain scientific reasoning, contribute to public misunderstandings, and, at times, inadvertently reinforce stereotypes and messages that undermine the goals of inclusive science. This paper 1) examines the generative potential of metaphors to the advancement of scientific knowledge and science communication, 2) highlights the ways in which outdated metaphors may limit scientific inquiry and contribute to public misunderstandings, and 3) critically analyzes the implications of cryptic social and political messages embedded in common metaphors in the life sciences.},

This paper fills this gap by defining the method as maximizing the fourth-corner correlation between linear combinations, by providing novel algorithms, which demonstrate relationships with related methods, and by making a detailed study of possible biplots and associated approximations. The method is illustrated using ecological data on the abundances of species in sites and where the species are characterized by traits and sites by environmental variables. The trait data and environment data form the external constraints and the question is which traits and environmental variables are associated, how these associations drive species abundances and how they can be displayed in biplots. With microbiome data becoming widely available, these and related multivariate methods deserve more study as they might be routinely used in the future.},

First, the family of standard statistical techniques based on the linear response model is dealt with, because they are conceptually the simplest and provide a basis for what follows, even though their ecological application is restricted. Second, a family of somewhat more complex statistical techniques are outlined which are formal extensions of the standard linear techniques and incorporate unimodal (Gaussian-like) response models explicitly. Finally, the family of heuristic techniques is considered based on weighted averaging. These are not more complex than the standard linear techniques, but implicitly fit a simple unimodal response model rather than a linear one. Ordination diagrams and their interpretation on bi plots and joint plots are also given in the chapter.

  abstract = {This chapter concerns data analysis techniques that assist the interpretation of community composition in terms of species' responses to environmental gradients in the broadest sense. All species occur in a characteristic, limited range of habitats; and within their range, they tend to be most abundant around their particular environmental optimum. The composition of biotic communities thus changes along environmental gradients. Direct gradient analysis is a regression problem---fitting curves or surfaces to the relation between each species' abundance, probability of occurrence, and one or more environmental variables. Ecologists have independently developed a variety of alternative techniques. Many of these techniques are essentially heuristic, and have a less secure theoretical basis. This chapter presents a theory of gradient analysis, in which the heuristic techniques are integrated with regression, calibration, ordination and constrained ordination as distinct, well-defined statistical problems. The various techniques used for each type of problem are classified in families according to their implicit response model and the method used to estimate parameters of the model. Three such families are considered. The treatment shown here unites such apparently disparate data analysis techniques as linear regression, principal components analysis, redundancy analysis, Gaussian ordination, weighted averaging, reciprocal averaging, detrended correspondence analysis, and canonical correspondence analysis in a single theoretical framework.},

We defend detrended correspondence analysis by theoretical arguments and by reanalyzing data that previously gave bad results. We show by examples that constrained ordination can yield more informative views on effects of interest compared to unconstrained ordination (where such effects can be invisible) and show how constrained axes can be interpreted. Constrained ordination uses an ANOVA/regression approach to enable the user to focus on particular aspects of species community data, in particular the effects of qualitative and quantitative environmental variables. We close with an analysis examining the interaction effects between two factors, and we demonstrate how principal response curves can help in their visualisation.

  abstract = {Aim Spatial analysis of the distribution and density of species is of continuing interest within theoretical and applied ecology. Species distribution models (SDMs) are being increasingly used to analyse count, presence--absence and presence-only data sets. There is a growing literature on dynamic SDMs (which incorporate temporal variation in species distribution), joint SDMs (which simultaneously analyse the correlated distribution of multiple species) and geostatistical models (which account for similarity between nearby sites caused by unobserved covariates). However, no previous study has combined all three attributes within a single framework. Innovation We develop spatial dynamic factor analysis for use as a `joint, dynamic SDM' (JDSDM), which uses geostatistical methods to account for spatial similarity when estimating one or more `factors'. Each factor evolves over time following a density-dependent (Gompertz) process, and the log-density of each species is approximated as a linear combination of different factors. We demonstrate a JDSDM using two multispecies case studies (an annual survey of bottom-associated species in the Bering Sea and a seasonal survey of butterfly density in the continental USA), and also provide our code publicly as an R package. Main conclusions Case study applications show that that JDSDMs can be used for species ordination, i.e. showing that dynamics for butterfly species within the same genus are significantly more correlated than for species from different genera. We also demonstrate how JDSDMs can rapidly identify dominant patterns in community dynamics, including the decline and recovery of several Bering Sea fishes since 2008, and the `flight curves' typical of early or late-emerging butterflies. We conclude by suggesting future research that could incorporate phylogenetic relatedness or functional similarity, and propose that our approach could be used to monitor community dynamics at large spatial and temporal scales.},

Using a coupled aerosol-climate model, with eruption parameters constrained by recently re-dated ice core records and historical observations of the aerosol cloud, we reconstruct the radiative forcing resulting from a sequence of two major volcanic eruptions in 536 and 540 CE. We estimate that the decadal-scale Northern Hemisphere (NH) extra-tropical radiative forcing from this volcanic ``double event'' was larger than that of any period in existing reconstructions of the last 1200~years. Earth system model simulations including the volcanic forcing show peak NH mean temperature anomalies reaching more than -2~{$^\circ$}C, and show agreement with the limited number of available maximum latewood density temperature reconstructions. The simulations also produce decadal-scale anomalies of Arctic sea ice. The simulated cooling is interpreted in terms of probable impacts on agricultural production in Europe, and implies a high likelihood of multiple years of significant decreases in crop production across Scandinavia, supporting the theory of a connection between the 536 and 540 eruptions and evidence of societal crisis dated to the mid-6th century.},

Besides seed sowing, alternative restoration methods that build on locally available propagule sources, such as hay transfer, should also be considered and given high priority. The transfer of hay from a donor site to the restoration site serves a double aim by introducing target species and suppressing weeds. We tested the applicability of hay transfer in restoring species-rich grassland in a former cropland in Hungary, over six years of post-restoration monitoring from 2015 to 2020. We sampled the plant species composition of the three donor sites (target state of restoration) and the area surrounding the restoration site. We found that six year after restoration, a species-rich grassland developed with 42 successfully established specialist species that had a cover of 45\%. Most specialist species became established from the hay from the second to the sixth year, but the surrounding areas also provided additional propagule sources. Among the eight analysed functional traits, seed mass of the transferred species was the best predictor of the establishment of specialists, and we found that small-seeded species had an establishment advantage in the first years after restoration. Our results suggest that hay transfer can be a suitable nature-based solution for local grassland restoration projects and its potential should be utilized especially in regions where suitable donor sites are present in sufficient quantity and quality.},

However, existing constrained ordination methods do not explicitly account for community composition that cannot be explained by the predictors, so that they have the potential to misrepresent community composition if not all predictors are available in the data. We propose and develop a set of new methods for ordination and joint species distribution modelling (JSDM) as part of the generalized linear latent variable model (GLLVM) framework, that incorporate predictors directly into an ordination. This includes a new ordination method that we refer to as concurrent ordination, as it simultaneously constructs unconstrained and constrained latent variables. Both unmeasured residual covariation and predictors are incorporated into the ordination by simultaneously imposing reduced rank structures on the residual covariance matrix and on fixed-effects. We evaluate the method with a simulation study, and show that the proposed developments outperform canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) for Poisson and Bernoulli responses, and perform similar to redundancy analysis (RDA) for normally distributed responses, the two most popular methods for constrained ordination in community ecology. Two examples with real data further demonstrate the benefits of concurrent ordination, and the need to account for residual covariation in the analysis of multivariate data. This article contextualizes the role of constrained ordination in the GLLVM and JSDM frameworks, while developing a new ordination method that incorporates the best of unconstrained and constrained ordination, and which overcomes some of the deficiencies of existing classical ordination methods.},

In recent years, also Joint Species Distribution Models and Generalized Linear Latent Variale Models have gained in popularity when the goal is to incorporate residual covariation between species that cannot be explained due to measured environmental covariates. Few software implementations of such models exist that can additionally incorporate phylogenetic information, and those that exist tend to utilize Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for estimation, so that model fitting takes a long time. In this article we develop new methods for quickly and flexibly fitting phylogenetic mixed-effects models, potentially incorporating residual covariation between species using latent variables, with the possibility to estimate the strength of phylogenetic structuring in species responses per environmental covariate, and while incorporating correlation between different covariate effects. By combining Variational approximations, a sparse approximation to the phylogenetic precision matrix, and parallel computation, phylogenetic mixed-effects models can be fitted much more quickly than the current state-of-the-art. Two simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed combination of approximations is fast and enjoys high accuracy. We explore sensitivity of the approximation to the ordering of species with a real world dataset of wood-decaying fungi.},

  abstract = {It is common practice for ecologists to examine species niches in the study of community composition. The response curve of a species in the fundamental niche is usually assumed to be quadratic. The centre of a quadratic curve represents a species' optimal environmental conditions, and the width its ability to tolerate deviations from the optimum. Most multivariate methods assume species respond linearly to niche axes, or with a quadratic curve that is of equal width for all species. However, it is widely understood that some species have the ability to better tolerate deviations from their optimal environment (generalists) compared to other (specialist) species. Rare species often tolerate a smaller range of environments than more common species, corresponding to a narrow niche. We propose a new method, for ordination and fitting Joint Species Distribution Models, based on Generalized Linear Mixed-effects Models, which relaxes the assumptions of equal tolerances. By explicitly estimating species maxima, and species optima and tolerances per ecological gradient, we can better explore how species relate to each other.},

  abstract = {The ecological niche is a fundamental concept in ecology that can be used in order better understand species relationships. The overlap in species niches provides a measure of the likelihood for species to co-occur. Most approaches that quantify niche overlap have been based on distance and similarity indices, for pairwise combinations of species. In this paper, we suggest that niche overlap can be calculated from the predictions of a model. Using a statistical model to predict niche overlap provides various benefits, includes the possibility to adjust the model to properties of the data. We demonstrate this using an example dataset of an ecological community of Foraminifera species, to which we fit a generalized linear latent variable model (GLLVM). GLLVMs are a flexible class of models that allow to estimate the distribution of species using both measured environmental predictors and residual covariation between species. We demonstrate how to calculate niche overlap from GLLVMs for any combination of species, and separately for different environments. Predicting niche overlap from a model further expands the toolset available to ecologists for the exploration of species co-occurrence patterns.},

A major unresolved issue relating to internal climate dynamics is the mode and tempo of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation variability, and the significance of decadal-to-centennial scale changes in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation strength in regulating the climate of the last millennium. Here we use the time-constrained high-resolution local radiocarbon reservoir age offset derived from an absolutely dated annually resolved shell chronology spanning the past 1,350 years, to reconstruct changes in surface ocean circulation and climate. The water mass tracer data presented here from the North Icelandic shelf, combined with previously published data from the Arctic and subtropical Atlantic, show that surface Atlantic meridional overturning circulation dynamics likely amplified the relatively warm conditions during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the relatively cool conditions during the Little Ice Age within the North Atlantic sector.}

In this study, the response of the biological community, including macrobiotic biofouling and microbial community, to translocation of seaweed attaching substrate were investigated. The results showed that the seaweed coverage ratio significantly reduced after the translocation, the macrobiotic biofouling community diversity on attaching substrates increased after the translocation, and the transplanted substrates had more percentage cover and lower biodiversity than the untransplanted substrates. In addition, highest diversity was found on microbial community after the translocation. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed that the microbial community on the transfered substrates was significantly different from that before and without transfer. Co-occurrence network analysis showed that the degree of bacterial community network connection was highest before the translocation. The result revealed that the translocation of seaweed substrate could affect the biological community composition, and could accelerate the changes in macrobiotic biofouling community on the back of substrates.},

Besides basal respiration rate and microbial carbon, the BIOLOG (R) method was applied to estimate the microbial ability in utilizing different carbon sources. Ordination methods to obtain a biological characterization of sampling sites, and principal response curve methods to reveal the carbon utilizing ability during the whole cultivating process were utilized in this study. The Nemerow composite index, which was used to assess the heavy metal contamination based on six total metal contents, hardly detected the overall discrepancy. However, there were significant differences in microbial functioning parameters at the five sampling plots, which provided more information about the environmental condition. The increases of certain metal contents and pH were accompanied by higher basal respirations (BAS). The increase of BAS did not correspond with the increase of carbon utilization and the higher level of microbial carbon contents. On the whole, these findings indicated that microbes can provide complementary information about different degrees of contamination and can be regarded as a usefully environmental indicator.

Understanding the factors that determine the abundance and distribution of species is a fundamental goal of ecology, however, there is a lack of understanding of how degradation affects the deterministic processes that determine community structure and species composition. Here, we used the Hierarchical Model of Species Communities (HMSC) to explore how degradation affects environmental filtering and biotic interactions processes in Hulun Buir Steppe. The results showed that (1) The sensitivity of species to environmental change increases with deeper degradation. At the same time most of the species show some adaptation to environmental changes in the moderately and severely degraded stages. (2) Correlation between species traits and environmental variables weakened with deeper degradation. (3) Species interactions decrease significantly with increasing degradation and are typically dominated by positive interactions in severely degraded stages. Species interactions affected by degradation may be characterized by a shift from positive to negative interactions, the disappearance of negative interactions, and a decrease in both positive and negative interactions. The application of joint species distribution modeling to evaluate the impact of degradation on environmental filtering and biotic interactions in steppe community reassembly is a new perspective that offers valuable insights for restoration decisions in degraded steppes.},

  abstract = {The mean-variance relationship is a central property of multivariate abundances -- it has been shown that when not accounted for, potentially serious artifacts can be introduced to analyses. One such effect is the confounding of location and dispersion. Roberts (in press) recently argued that mean-variance relationships are not important in understanding properties of distance-based analyses, and that row standardisation fixes the problem of apparent location-dispersion confounding. We use simulation to disprove both statements. In situations where there is a shift in total abundance from one location to the next, the effects of location-dispersion confounding can be considerable. But we also show that even if there is no systematic difference in total abundance between two communities, and no change in dispersion, distance-based analysis may falsely claim that there is a change. We agree that multivariate abundance data are hierarchical, and that it is helpful to study effects at both the species-level and the community level. However, disentangling species-level from community-level effects is not possible without a hierarchical method of analysis. Recently proposed model-based approaches to ordination offer a way forward to resolve the issues discussed here.},

Key advantages of this approach include interpretability, flexibility, and efficiency, which we explain in detail and illustrate by example. The steps in a model-based approach to analysis are outlined, with an emphasis on key features arising in a multivariate context. A key distinction in the model-based approach is the emphasis on diagnostic checking to ensure that the model provides reasonable agreement with the observed data. Two examples are presented that illustrate how the model-based approach can provide insights into ecological problems not previously available. In the first example, we test for a treatment effect in a study where different sites had different sampling intensities, which was handled by adding an offset term to the model. In the second example, we incorporate trait information into a model for ordinal response in order to identify the main reasons why species differ in their environmental response.},

  abstract = {One response to a pedagogical shift towards student-centred and active learning approaches to promote student learning in STEM is the flipped classroom. However, there has been inconsistency in the design and implementation of the flipped classroom and its impact on student learning. This review systematically analysed 30 empirical studies on flipped classrooms in formal, K-16 science and maths classrooms to understand theoretical underpinnings leading to different approaches to flipped classrooms and the impact of flipped classrooms on student learning in science and maths classrooms. The selected studies were qualitatively analysed, and the results showed that: (1) there is more published literature on the flipped classroom identified in post-secondary science and mathematics classrooms, (2) the design of the flipped classroom is rarely grounded in theoretical frameworks especially in science classrooms, and (3) the flipped classroom has an overall positive effect on students' science and maths learning. This study highlights the importance of using explicit theoretical frameworks aligned with contemporary learning theories to guide the design, implementation, and evaluation of the flipped classroom. Additionally, there is a need for future research to utilise design-based methodologies to maximise the positive impact of the flipped classroom on student learning.},

  abstract = {This article presents a generalized linear latent variable model for analyzing multivariate longitudinal data within the hidden Markov model framework. The relationships among multiple items are captured by several common latent factors. The linear coregionalization method is adopted to model the temporal processes of latent variables. The merit of this modeling strategy lies in the fact that the processes among latent variables are nonseparate and codependent from each other. To account for possible heterogeneity and interrelationship among the longitudinal data, a hidden Markov model is introduced to model the transition probabilities across different latent states over time. The Monte Carlo expectation conditional maximization (MCECM) algorithm is developed to estimate unknown parameters in the proposed model. The Wald- and score-type statistics are proposed to test the related dependence of processes. A simulation study is conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed methodology. An example from a longitudinal study of cocaine use is taken to illustrate the proposed methodology.},

  abstract = {Altitudinal changes in the diversity of plants and animals have been well documented; however, soil animals received little attention in this context and it is unclear whether their diversity follows general altitudinal distribution patterns. Changbai Mountain is one of few well-conserved mountain regions comprising natural ecosystems on the Eurasian continent. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the diversity and community composition of Collembola along ten altitudinal sites representing five vegetation types from forest to alpine tundra. Among 7834 Collembola individuals, 84 morphospecies were identified. Species richness varied marginally significant with altitude and generally followed a unimodal relationship with altitude. By contrast, the density of Collembola did not change in a consistent way with altitude. Collembola communities changed gradually with altitude, with local habitat-related factors (soil and litter carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, litter carbon content, and soil pH) and climatic variables (precipitation seasonality) identified as major drivers of changes in Collembola community composition. Notably, local habitat-related factors explained more variation in Collembola assemblages than climatic variables. The results suggest that local habitat-related factors including precipitation and temperature are the main drivers of changes in Collembola communities with altitude. Specifically, soil and litter carbon-to-nitrogen ratio correlated positively with Collembola communities at high altitudes, whereas soil pH correlated positively at low altitudes. This documents that altitudinal gradients provide unique opportunities for identifying factors driving the community composition of not only above- but also belowground invertebrates.},

  abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) significantly contribute to plant resource acquisition and play important roles in mediating plant interactions and soil carbon (C) dynamics. However, it remains unclear how AMF communities respond to climate change. We assessed impacts of warming and precipitation alterations (30\% increase or decrease) on soil AMF communities, and examined major ecological processes shaping the AMF community assemblage in a Tibetan alpine meadow. Our results showed that warming significantly increased root biomass, and available nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in soil. While precipitation alterations increased AMF abundances, they did not significantly affect the composition or diversity of AMF communities. In contrast, warming altered the composition of AMF communities and reduced their Shannon--Wiener index and Pielou's evenness. In particular, warming shifted the AMF community composition in favor of Diversisporaceae over Glomeraceae, likely through its impact on soil N and P availability. In addition, AMF communities were phylogenetically random in the unwarmed control but clustered in warming plots, implying more deterministic community assembly under climate warming. Warming enhancement of root growth, N and P availability likely reduced plant C-allocation to AMF, imposing stronger environmental filtering on AMF communities. We further proposed a conceptual framework that integrates biological and geochemical processes into a mechanistic understanding of warming and precipitation changes' effects on AMF. Taken together, these results suggest that soil AMF communities may be more sensitive to warming than expected, highlighting the need to monitor their community structure and associated functional consequences on plant communities and soil C dynamics under the future warmer climate.},

  abstract = {Gold mining plays an essential role on the social and economic development. However, mining activities leads to destructive changes in ground structure and biodiversity, triggering considerable environmental problems. This study proposed a field observation to evaluate the short-term efforts of the artificial restoration measures taken by the Two-River Source Nature Reserve Administration from 2010 to 2015 in an abandoned gold mining area in Altai Mountain, Northwest China. The effects of different ecological restoration measures on soil and vegetation recovery were examined by calculating the richness index, dominance index, diversity index, evenness index, aboveground biomass, vegetation coverage, species number and soil-rock ratio index of the recovered area. Further, a principal component analysis (PCA) was used to compare the efficiency of each artificial measure. The results showed that gold mining activities cause serious environmental degradation in natural landscapes. The soil-rock ratio of the abandoned mining area was reduced by 98\% compared with the original grassland. The surface vegetation was destructively destroyed, and the surface soil was stripped. Restoration measures considerably improved ecological conditions, which were reflected by surface biomass, diversity index and the soil-rock ratio, as well as accelerated ecological rebuilding processes in abandoned mining areas. The ecological efficiency of the single restoration measures assessed, such as soil measures, water replenishment measures and biological measures, was not significant. The average values of various indexes of these measures showed lower values of 0.12--0.45. The combination of various measures can not only improve the soil environment but can also lead to changes in plant community diversity and significant ecological efficiency. This was reflected by the values of various indexes, which reached higher values of 0.4--1.21. As far as the same kind of restoration measure is considered, the longer the restoration period, the better the recovery effect.},

  abstract = {Understanding how the environment shapes species distribution and affects biodiversity patterns is important in ecology and conservation. Environmental stressors like climate change and anthropogenic impacts may lead to a significant decline in aquatic biodiversity. Therefore, it is imperative to characterise the current community structure and explore environmental drivers that may be important for the future community structure, also in biogeographic areas that are largely outside of the main research focus. We investigated how fish species abundances in the Karun River basin, southwest of Iran, respond to environmental predictors along a longitudinal gradient of 108 sampling sites using Generalised Linear Latent Variable Models (GLLVMs). We evaluated the response of 46 fish species to seven environmental predictors and interpreted the bivariate species co-occurrences in the residual covariance matrix in the light of potential biotic interactions. The latent variable model explained 62\% of data variability in fish abundance. We identified temperature as the most important predictor, with alien species responding positively to warmer conditions, suggesting potential distribution shifts due to climate change. In contrast, endemic species showed negative responses to higher temperatures, highlighting their vulnerability. Fish abundance responses to total nitrogen concentration and average precipitation were generally negative, indicating threats from nutrient enrichment and changing rainfall patterns. There were a few systematic negative co-occurrences between alien and native fish species, which may reflect both differing environmental preferences and potential negative interactions. The model showed high predictive accuracy for the occurrence of native species, while accuracy was lower for endemic and alien species, likely due to their more limited geographical distributions. This study contributes to the global understanding of how environmental drivers shape fish communities in semi-arid river systems. By highlighting the contrasting responses of endemic and alien species to selected stressors, it provides valuable insights for predicting and managing biodiversity under climate change, offering a framework applicable to similar ecosystems worldwide.},

  abstract = {Scientific investigation is of value only insofar as relevant results are obtained and communicated, a task that requires organizing, evaluating, analysing and unambiguously communicating the significance of data. In this context, working with ecological data, reflecting the complexities and interactions of the natural world, can be a challenge. Recent innovations for statistical analysis of multifaceted interrelated data make obtaining more accurate and meaningful results possible, but key decisions of the analyses to use, and which components to present in a scientific paper or report, may be overwhelming. We offer a 10-step protocol to streamline analysis of data that will enhance understanding of the data, the statistical models and the results, and optimize communication with the reader with respect to both the procedure and the outcomes. The protocol takes the investigator from study design and organization of data (formulating relevant questions, visualizing data collection, data exploration, identifying dependency), through conducting analysis (presenting, fitting and validating the model) and presenting output (numerically and visually), to extending the model via simulation. Each step includes procedures to clarify aspects of the data that affect statistical analysis, as well as guidelines for written presentation. Steps are illustrated with examples using data from the literature. Following this protocol will reduce the organization, analysis and presentation of what may be an overwhelming information avalanche into sequential and, more to the point, manageable, steps. It provides guidelines for selecting optimal statistical tools to assess data relevance and significance, for choosing aspects of the analysis to include in a published report and for clearly communicating information.},

If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},
